<h3><span class="smcap">I. Introductory.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> would be difficult to name any subject of investigation, the progress
of which during our time has been more remarkable than that
in the field of stellar astronomy. Several features of this progress are
especially noteworthy. One of these is the mere extension of research.
A natural result of the northern hemisphere being the home of civilized
peoples was that, thirty years ago, the study of the southern
heavens had been comparatively neglected. It is true that the curiosity
of the inquiring astronomers of the past would not be satisfied without
their knowing something of what was to be seen south of the equator.
Various enterprises and establishments had therefore contributed to
our knowledge of the region in question. As far back as 1667, during
a voyage to St. Helena, Halley catalogued the brighter stars in the
region near the South Pole. About 1750 Lacaille, of France, established
an observing station at the Cape of Good Hope, and made a catalogue
of several thousand stars which has remained a handy book for
the astronomer up to the present time. In 1834&ndash;38 Sir John Herschel
made a special voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, armed with the best
telescopes which the genius of his father had shown him how to construct,
for the purpose of doing for the southern heavens as much as
possible of what his father had done for the northern. The work
of this expedition forms one of the most important and interesting
chapters in the history of astronomic science. Not only is Herschel’s
magnificent volume a classic of astronomy, but the observations which it
contains are still as carefully and profitably studied as any that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
since been made. They may be said to form the basis of our present
knowledge of the region which they included in their scope.</p>

<p>Herschel’s work may be described as principally in the nature of an
exploration. He had no instruments for accurately determining the
positions of stars. In the latter field the first important contributions
after Lacaille were made by Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New
South Wales, and Rumker, his assistant, at Paramata. Johnson, of
England, about 1830, introduced modern accuracy into the construction
of a rather limited catalogue of stars which he observed at St. Helena.
About the same time the British Government established the observatory
at the Cape of Good Hope, which has maintained its activity to
the present time, though, at first, its means were extremely limited.
About the middle of the century the Government of New South Wales
established, first at Williamstown and then at Melbourne, an observatory
which has worked in the same field with marked success.</p>

<p>An American enterprise in the same direction was that of Captain
James M. Gilliss, who, in 1849, organized an astronomical expedition
to Chili. The principal motive of this enterprise was the determining
of the solar parallax by observations upon Venus and Mars near the
time of their nearest approach to the earth. As these observations
would take but a small part of his time, Gilliss determined to take with
him instruments for determining the positions of the stars. He established
his observatory at a point near Santiago, where he continued
his observations for nearly three years. He was a practical observer,
but an untoward circumstance detracted from the value of his work.
His observatory was built upon a rocky eminence, a foundation which
seemed to afford the best possible guarantee of the stability of his
instruments. He made no attempt to reduce his observations till after
his return home. Then it was found that the foundation, through the
expansion and contraction due to the heat of the sun, was subject to a
diurnal change which made it extremely difficult to derive good results
from his careful work. It was not until 1896, more than thirty years
after his death, that the catalogue of the stars observed by him was at
last completed and published.</p>

<p>We do not derogate in any way from the merit of these efforts in
saying that they could not lead to results comparable with those of the
score of richly equipped northern observatories which the leading
nations and universities of Europe had endowed and supported for
more than a hundred years. Only within the last thirty years has it
been possible to bring our knowledge of the southern heavens up to
a satisfactory stage. Now, however, the progress of southern astronomy,
if we may use the term, is such that in several points our knowledge
of the southern heavens surpasses that of the northern ones. If
we measure institutions by the importance of the work they are doing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
there are several in the southern hemisphere which must to-day be
placed in the first rank.</p>

<p>The history and work of the Cordova Observatory are of special
interest. In 1870 Dr. B.&nbsp;A. Gould, who might fairly be considered
as the father of modern American astronomy, conceived the idea of
establishing an observatory of the first class in South America. He
found the President and Governor of the Argentine Republic ready to
support his scheme with a liberality well fitted to impress us with a
high sense of their standard of civilization. In a year or two the
observatory at Cordova was in active operation. A statement of its
work belongs to a subsequent chapter. Suffice it to remark here that
Dr. Gould continued in active charge until 1885, when he returned
home, and was succeeded by Thome, the present director.</p>

<p>A few years after Gould went to Cordova, Gill was made director
of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. The rapid growth
of this institution to one of the first rank is due no less to the scientific
ability of the new director than to the unflagging energy which he
has devoted to the enlargement of the resources of the institution.
The great fact which he sought to impress upon his supporters was
that the southern celestial hemisphere was as large as the northern,
and therefore equally worthy of study.</p>

<p>In any general review of the progress of stellar astronomy during
the past twenty years, we should find Harvard University before us
at every turn. What it has done will be seen, perhaps in an imperfect
way, in subsequent chapters. Not satisfied with the northern
hemisphere, it has established a branch at Arequipa, Peru, in which its
methods of observation and research are extended to the south celestial
pole. Its principal specialties have been the continuous exploration of
the heavens. Celestial photography, photometry and spectroscopy sum
up its fields of activity. For more than ten years it might be almost
said that a sleepless watch of the heavens has been kept up by an all-seeing
photographic eye, with an accuracy of which the world has
hardly had a conception. The completeness with which its work has
been done has recently been shown in a striking way. Our readers are
doubtless acquainted with the singular character of the minor planet
Eros, whose orbit passes through that of Mars, as one link of a chain
passes through another, and which comes nearer the earth at certain
times than any other celestial body, the moon excepted. When the
character of the orbit became established, it was of interest to know
whether the planet had ever been observed as a fixed star at former
oppositions. Chandler, having computed the path of the planet at the
most important of the oppositions, beginning with 1892&ndash;94, communicated
his results to Director Pickering, and suggested a search of the
Harvard photographs to see if the planet could be found on them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
result was the discovery of the planet upon more than a score of plates
taken at various times during the preceding ten years. New stars
were formerly supposed to be of very rare occurrence, but since the
Harvard system of photographing the heavens has been introduced,
no less than three have been known to break out.</p>

<p>The great revelations of our times have come through the application
of the spectroscope to the measurement of motions in the line
of sight from us to a star. No achievement of the intellect of man
would have seemed farther without the range of possibility to the
thinker of half a century ago, than the discoveries of invisible bodies
which are now being made with this instrument. The revelations of
the telescope take us by surprise. But, if we consider what the thinker
alluded to might regard as attainable, they are far surpassed by those
of the spectroscope. The dark bodies, planets, we may call them,
which are revolving round the stars, must be forever invisible in any
telescope that it would be possible to construct. They would remain
invisible if the power of the instrument were increased ten thousand
times. And yet, if there are inhabitants on these planets, our astronomers
could tell them more of the motions of the world on which they
live than the human race knew of the motions of the earth before
the time of Copernicus.</p>

<p>The men and institutions which have contributed to this result
are so few in number that it will not be tedious to mention at least the
principal actors. The possibility of measuring the motions of the stars
in the line of sight by means of the spectroscope was first pointed out
by Mr. now Sir William Huggins. He actually put the method into
operation. As soon as its feasibility was demonstrated it was taken up
at Greenwich. In these earlier attempts, eye methods alone were used,
and the results were not always reliable. Then spectrum photography
was applied at the astrophysical observatory at Potsdam by Vogel.
Thence the photographic method soon spread to Meudon and Pulkova.
But, as often happens when new fields of research are opened, we find
them ablaze in quarters where we should least expect. The successful
application of the method requires not only the best spectroscope, but
the most powerful telescope at command. Ten years ago the most powerful
telescope in the world was at the Lick Observatory. Mr. D.&nbsp;O.
Mills put at its eye end the best spectrograph that human art could
make at that time, the work of Brashear. It is Campbell, who, with
this instrument, has inaugurated a series of discoveries in the line in
question which are without a parallel.</p>

<p>A mere survey of what has been done in the various lines we have
mentioned would be far from giving an idea of the real significance
of the advance we are considering. Cataloguing the stars, estimating
their magnitudes, recording and comparing their spectra and determining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
their motions, might be considered as, after all, barren of
results of the highest human interest. When we know the exact
position of every star in the heavens, the direction in which it is
moving and the character of its spectral lines, how much wiser are we?</p>

<p>What could hardly have been foreseen fifty years ago, is that these
various classes of results are now made to combine and converge upon
the greatest problem which the mind of man has ever attempted to
grasp&mdash;that of the structure of the universe. The study of variable
stars has suddenly fallen into line, so to speak, so that now, it is uniting
itself to the study of all the other subjects to give us at least a faint
conception of what the solution of this problem may be.</p>

<p>One of the principal objects of the present chapter is to make a
comparison of these various researches, and discuss the views respecting
the constitution of the stars individually, as well as of the universe
as a whole, to which they lead us. But there are a number of details
to be considered singly before we can combine results in this way. Our
early chapters will therefore be devoted to the special features and
individual problems of stellar astronomy which have occupied the minds
of astronomers from the beginning of their work to the present time.
Keeping these details in mind, we can profitably proceed to the consideration
of the general conclusions to be drawn from them.</p>

<p>We may begin by refreshing our memories on some points, an
understanding of which must be taken for granted. What are familiarly
known as the heavenly bodies belong to two classes. Those nearest
to us form a sort of colony far removed from all the others, called the
solar system. The principal bodies of this system are the sun and
eight great planets with their moons, revolving round it. On one
of the planets, small when compared with the great bodies of the universe,
but large to our every-day conceptions, we dwell. The other
planets appear to us as stars. Four of them, Venus, Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn, are distinguished from the fixed stars by their superior
brightness and characteristic motions. Of the remaining three, Mercury
will only rarely excite notice, while Uranus and Neptune are as
good as invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the solar system are vast when compared with
any terrestrial standard. A cannon shot going incessantly at its utmost
speed would be a thousand years in crossing the orbit of Neptune from
side to side. But vast as the dimensions are, they sink into insignificance
when compared with the distance of the stars. Outside the solar
system are spaces which, so far as we know, are absolutely void, save
here and there a comet or a meteor, until we look far outside the region
which a cannon shot would cross in a million of years.</p>

<p>The nearest star is thousands of times farther away than the most
distant planet. Scattered at these inconceivable distances are the bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to which our attention is directed in the present work. If we are asked
what they are, we may reply that the stars are suns. But we might
equally well say that the sun is one of the stars; a small star, indeed,
surrounded by countless others, many of which are much larger and
brighter than itself. We shall treat our theme as far as possible by
what we may call the natural method, beginning with what, being most
obvious to the eye, was first noticed by man, or will be first noticed by
an observer, and tracing knowledge up step by step to its present state.</p>

<p>Several features of the universe of stars will be evident at a glance.
One of these is the diversity of the apparent brightness, or, in technical
language, of the magnitudes of the stars. A few far outshine the great
mass of their companions. A greater number are of what we may call
medium brightness; there is a yet larger number of fainter ones, and
about one half of all those seen by a keen eye under favorable conditions
are so near the limit of visibility as to escape ordinary notice.
Moreover, those which we see are but an insignificant fraction of the
number revealed by the telescope. The more we increase our optical
power, the greater the number that come into view. How many millions
may exist in the heavens it is scarcely possible even to guess. The
photographic maps of the heavens now being made probably show
fifty millions, perhaps one hundred millions or more.</p>

<p>Another evident feature is the tendency of the brighter stars to
cluster into groups, known as constellations. The latter are extremely
irregular, so that it is impossible to decide where one constellation
should end and another begin, or to which constellation a certain star
may belong. Hence, we can neither define the constellations nor say
what is their number, and the division of the stars among them is a
somewhat arbitrary proceeding.</p>

<p>A third feature is the Milky Way or Galaxy, which, to ordinary
vision, appears as an irregular succession of cloud-like forms spanning
the heavens. We now know that these seeming clouds are really congeries
of stars too small to be individually visible to the naked eye.
We shall hereafter see that the stars of the Galaxy form, so to speak,
the base on which the universe appears to be constructed. Each of
these three features will be considered in its proper place.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II. Magnitudes of the Stars.</span></h3>

<p>The apparent brightness of a star, as we see it from the earth,
depends upon two causes&mdash;its intrinsic brilliancy or the quantity of
light which it actually emits, and its distance from us. It follows that
if all the stars were of equal intrinsic brightness we could determine
their relative distances by measuring the respective amounts of light
which we receive from them. The quantity of light in such a case
varies inversely as the square of the distance. This will be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
evident by <a href="#ip_233">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>, where S represents the position of a star, regarded
as a luminous point, while A and B are screens placed at such
a distance that each will receive the same amount of light from the
star. If the screen B is twice as far as the screen A, its sides must be
twice as large as those of A in order that it shall receive all the light
that would fall on A. In this case its surface will be four times the
surface of A. It is then evident that any small portion of the surface
of B will receive one fourth as much light as an equal portion of
surface A. Thus an eye or a telescope in the position B will receive
from the star one fourth as much light as in the position A, and the
star will seem one fourth as bright.</p>

<div id="ip_233" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span></div></div>

<p>The fact is, however, that the stars are very unequal in their actual
brightness, and in consequence the apparent magnitude of a star gives
us no clue to its distance. Among the nearer of the stars are some
scarcely, if at all, visible to the naked eye, while among the brighter
ones are several whose distances are immeasurably great. A remarkable
example is that of Caropes, the second brightest star in the heavens.</p>

<p>For these reasons astronomers are obliged to content themselves,
in the first place, with determinations of the actual amount of light
that the various stars send to us, or their apparent brilliancy, without
regard to their distance or actual brilliancy. The ancient astronomers
divided all the stars they could see into six classes, the number expressing
the apparent brightness being called the magnitude of the star.
The brightest ones, numbering in all about fourteen, were said to be
of the first magnitude. The fifty next in brightness were said to be of
the second magnitude. Three times as many, an order fainter, were of
the third magnitude. The progression was continued up to the sixth
magnitude, which included those which were barely visible.</p>

<p>As the stars are actually of every degree of apparent brilliancy,
no sharp line of demarkation could be drawn between those of one
magnitude and those of the magnitude next higher. Hence, different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
observers made different estimates, some calling a star of the second
magnitude which others would call of the first, while others would
designate a star of the third magnitude which others would call of the
second. It is therefore impossible to state with absolute numerical precision
what number of stars should be regarded of one magnitude and
what of another.</p>

<p>An idea of the magnitude of a star can be readily gained by the
casual observer. Looking at the heavens on almost any cloudless
evening, we may assume that the two, three or more brightest stars
which we see are of the first magnitude. As examples of those of the
second magnitude, may be taken the five brightest stars of the Dipper,
the Pole Star and the brighter stars of Cassiopeia. Some or all of
these objects can be seen on any clear night of the year in our latitude.
Stars of the third magnitude are so numerous that it is difficult to
select any one for comparison. The brightest star of the Pleiades
is really of this magnitude, but it does not appear so in consequence
of the five other stars by which it is surrounded. At a distance of
15° from the Pole Star, Beta Ursa Minoris is always visible, and may
be distinguished by being slightly redder than the Pole Star; it lies
between two fainter stars, the brighter of which is of the third and the
other of the fourth magnitude. The five readily visible but fainter
stars of the Pleiades are about of the fourth magnitude. Of the fifth
magnitude are the faintest stars which are easily visible to the naked
eye, while the sixth comprises those which are barely visible with
good eyes.</p>

<p>Modern astronomers, while adhering to the general system which
has come down to them from ancient times, have sought to give it
greater definiteness. Careful study showed that the actual amount
of light corresponding to the different magnitudes varied nearly in
geometrical progression from one magnitude to another, a conclusion
which accords with the well-known psychological law that the intensity
of sensation varies by equal amounts when the exciting cause varies in
geometrical progression. It was found that an average star of the
fifth magnitude gave between two and three times as much light as an
average one of the sixth; one of the fourth gave between two and three
times as much light as one of the fifth; and so on to the second. In
the case of the first magnitude, the diversity is so great that it is
scarcely possible to fix an average ratio. Sirius, for example, is really
six times as bright as Altair, which is commonly taken as a standard
for a first magnitude star. To give precision to their estimates, modern
astronomers are gradually seeking to lay the subject of magnitudes on
an exact basis by defining a change of one unit in the magnitude as
corresponding to an increase of about two and one half times in the
amount of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
If the practice of separating the visible stars into only six orders
of magnitude were continued without change, we should still have the
anomaly of including in one class stars of markedly different degrees of
brightness. Some more than twice as bright as others would be designated
of the same magnitude. Hence, to give quantitative exactness
to the results, a magnitude is regarded as a quantity which may have
any value whatever, and may be expressed by decimals&mdash;tenths or even
hundredths. Thus, we may have stars of magnitude 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc.,
or we may even subdivide yet farther and speak of stars having
magnitudes 5.11, 5.12, etc. Unfortunately, however, there is as yet
no way known of determining the amount of light received from a
star except by an estimate of its effect upon the eye. Two stars are
regarded as equal when they appear to the eye of equal brilliancy.
In such a case the judgment is very uncertain. Hence, observers have
endeavored to give greater precision to it by the use of photometers,&mdash;instruments
for measuring quantities of light. But even with this
instrument the observer must depend upon an estimated equality of
light as judged by the eye. The light from one star is increased or
diminished in a known proportion until it appears equal to that of
another star, which may be an artificial one produced by the flame of a
candle. The proportion of increase or diminution shows the difference
of magnitude between the two stars.</p>

<p>As we proceed to place the subject of photometric measures of star
light on this precise basis we find the problem to be a complex one.
In the first place not all the rays which come from a star are visible
to our eyes as light. But all the radiance, visible or invisible, may be
absorbed by a dark surface, and will then show its effect by heating that
surface. The most perfect measure of the radiance of a star would
therefore be the amount of heat which it conveys, because this expresses
what is going on in the body better than the amount of visible light
can do. But unfortunately the heating effect of the rays from a star
is far below what can be measured or even indicated by any known
instrument. We are therefore obliged to abandon any thought of
determining the total amount of radiation and confine ourselves to that
portion which we call light.</p>

<p>Here, when we aim at precision, we find that light, as we understand
it, is properly measured only by its effect on the optic nerve, and
there is no way of measuring this effect except by estimation. Thus, all
the photometer can do is to give us the means of increasing or diminishing
the light from one star, so that we can make it equal by estimation
to that from some other star or source of light.</p>

<p>The difficulty of reaching strict results in this way is increased by
the fact that stars are different in color. Two lights can be estimated
as equal with greater precision when they are of the same color than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
when their colors are different. An additional source of uncertainty
is brought in by what is known as the Purkinje phenomenon, after the
physicist who first observed it. He found that if we took two lights of
equal apparent brightness, the one red and the other green, and then
increased or diminished them in the same proportion, they would no
longer appear equal. In other words, the geometrical axiom that halves
or quarters of equal quantities are themselves equal, does not apply to
the effect of light on the eye. If we diminish the two equal lights, we
find that the green will look brighter than the red. If we increase
them in the same proportion, the red will look brighter than the green.
In other words, the red light will, to our vision, increase or fade away
more rapidly with a given amount of change than the green light will.</p>

<p>It is found in recent times that this law of change does not extend
progressively through all spectral colors. It is true that as we pass
from the red to the violet end of the spectrum the yellow fades away
less rapidly with a given diminution than does the red, and the green
still less rapidly than the yellow. But when we pass from the green
to the blue, it is said that the latter does not fade out quite so fast
as the green.</p>

<p>One obvious conclusion from all this is that two stars of different
colors which look equal to the naked eye will not look equal in the
telescope. The red or yellow star will look relatively brighter in a
telescope; the green or bluish one relatively brighter to the naked eye.</p>

<p>In recent times stars have been photographed on a large scale.
Their magnitudes can then be determined by the effect of the light
on the photographic plate, the impression of the star, as seen in a
microscope, being larger and more intense as the star is brighter. But
the magnitude thus determined is not proportional to the apparent
brightness as seen by the eye, because the photographic effect of blue
light is much greater than that of red light having the same apparent
brightness. In fact, the difference is so great that, with the chemicals
formerly used, red light was almost without photographic effect. Even
now, what we measure in taking the photograph of a star is almost
entirely the light in the more refrangible portions of the spectrum. It
appears, therefore, that when a blue and a yellow star, equally bright
to the naked eye, are photographed, the impression made on the negative
by the blue star will be greater than that made by the yellow one.
A distinction is therefore recognized between photographic and visual
magnitudes.</p>

<p>The photographic magnitudes of the stars are now being investigated
and catalogued on a scale even larger than that on which we
have studied the visual magnitudes. Yet we have to admit the non-correspondence
of the two systems. The bluer the star, the brighter
will be its photographic as compared with its visual magnitude. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
most that can be done is to bring about the best attainable agreement
between the two systems in the general average of all the stars.</p>

<p>Fortunately the differences between the colors of the stars are by
no means so great as those between the colors of natural objects around
us. All the stars radiate light of all colors; and although the difference
is quite appreciable either by the eye or by the photograph, it is not
so great as it would have been were the variations in color as wide as in
the case of terrestrial objects.</p>

<p>Two comprehensive surveys of the heavens, intended to determine
as accurately as possible the magnitudes of all the brighter stars, have
recently been undertaken. One of these is the Harvard photometry,
commenced by Professor Pickering at the Harvard Observatory, and
now extended to the Southern Hemisphere by the aid of a branch
establishment at Arequipa, Peru.</p>

<p>The instrument designed by Professor Pickering for his purpose is
termed a meridian photometer, and is so arranged that the observer
can see in the field of his telescope a reflected image of the Pole Star,
and, at the same time, the image of some other star while it is passing
the meridian. By a polarizing apparatus the image of the star to be
measured is made to appear of equal brightness with that of the Pole
Star, and the position of a Nicol prism, which brings out this equality,
shows the ratio between the magnitudes of the two stars.</p>

<p>The other survey, with the same object, is now being made at the
Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory, near Berlin. In the photometer
used by the German astronomers the image of one star is compared with
an artificial star formed by the flame of a candle. The work is performed
in a more elaborate way than at the Harvard Observatory, and
in consequence, only that part of the heavens, extending from the
equator to 40° north declination, has been completed and published.
A comparison of the results thus obtained with those of Professor
Pickering, shows a curious difference depending on the color of the
star. In the case of the reddest stars, the estimates are found to be
in fairly close agreement, Pickering’s being a little the fainter. But
in the case of the white or bluish stars, the estimates of the German
astronomers are more than one fourth of a magnitude greater than those
of Pickering. This corresponds to an increase of nearly one fifth in the
brightness. Whether this difference is to be regarded as purely psychological
or due to the instruments used, is an interesting question which
has not yet been settled. It is difficult to conceive how different instruments
should give results so different. On the other hand, the comparisons
made by the Germans make it difficult to accept the view that
the difference is due purely to the personality of the observers. There
are two German observers, Drs. Müller and Kempf, whose results agree
with each other exactly. On the other hand, Pritchard, at Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
made quite an extensive photometric survey, using an instrument by
which the light of one star was cut down by a wedge-shaped dark glass,
whereby any gradation of light could be produced. A comparison
shows that the results of Pritchard agree substantially with those of
Pickering. It is quite possible that the Purkinje phenomenon may be
the cause of the difference, the source of which is eminently worthy
of investigation.</p>

<p>This fact simply emphasizes the lack of mathematical precision in
photometric measurements of star light. Even apart from this difference
of color, the estimates of two observers will frequently differ
by 0.2 and sometimes by even 0.3 of a magnitude. These differences
correspond roughly to 20 or 30 per cent in the amount of light.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed from this that such estimates are of no
value for scientific purposes. Very important conclusions, based on
great numbers of stars, may be drawn even from these uncertain quantities.
Yet, it can hardly be doubted that if the light of a star could
be measured from time to time to its thousandth part, conclusions of
yet greater value and interest might be drawn from the measures.</p>

<p>We have said that in our modern system the aim has been to so
designate the magnitudes of the stars that a series of magnitudes in
arithmetical progression shall correspond to quantities of light ranging
in geometrical progression. We have also said that a change of one
unit of magnitude corresponds to a multiplication or division of the
light by about 2.5. On any scale of magnitude this factor of multiplication
constitutes the light-ratio of the scale. In recent times, after
much discussion of the subject and many comparisons of photometric
measures with estimates made in the old-fashioned way, there is a
general agreement among observers to fix the light ratio at the number
whose logarithm is 0.4. This is such that an increase of five units
in the number expressing the magnitude corresponds to a division of the
light by 100. If, for example, we take a standard star of magnitude
one and another of magnitude six, the first would be 100 times as
bright as the second. This corresponds to a light ratio slightly greater
than 2.5.</p>

<p>When this scale is adopted, the series of magnitudes may extend indefinitely
in both directions so that to every apparent brightness there
will be a certain magnitude. For example, if we assign the magnitude
1.0 to a certain star, taken as a standard, which would formerly have
been called a star of the first magnitude, then a star a little more than
2.5 times as bright would be of magnitude one less in number, that is,
of magnitude 0. The one next brighter in the series would be of
magnitude -1. So great is the diversity in the brightness of the stars
formerly called of the first magnitude that Sirius is still brighter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the imaginary star just mentioned, the number expressing its magnitude
being -1.4.</p>

<p>This suggests what we may regard as one of the capital questions in
celestial photometry. There being no limit to the extent of the scale,
what would be the stellar magnitude of the sun as we see it when expressed
this way on the photometric scale? Such a number is readily
derivable when we know the ratio between the light of the sun and
that of a star of known magnitude. Many attempts have been made
by observers to obtain this ratio; but the problem is one of great
difficulty, and the results have been extremely discordant. Amongst
them there are three which seem less liable to error than others; those
of Wollaston, Bond and Zöllner. Their results for the stellar magnitude
of the sun are as follow:</p>

<div class="p1 b1">

<p>Of these, Zöllner’s seems to be the best, and may, therefore, in
taking the mean, be entitled to double weight. The result will then be:</p>

<p>From this number may be readily computed the ratio of sunlight
to that of a star of any given magnitude. We thus find:</p>

<p>These parallaxes are those that the sun would have if placed at such
a distance as to shine with the brightness indicated in the first column.
They are generally larger than those of stars of the corresponding magnitudes,
from which we conclude that the sun is smaller than the
brighter of the stars.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Dr. W. M. HAFFKINE</span>,<br />

<span class="small">DIRECTOR-IN-CHIEF, GOVERNMENT PLAGUE RESEARCH LABORATORY, BOMBAY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> a previous paper I reviewed briefly the history of preventive inoculation
and described the results of my attempts to secure a ‘virus fixé’
in the case of cholera. It will be remembered that the two vaccines
finally obtained protected guinea pigs successfully against all possible
forms of cholera infection.</p>

<p>It was now necessary to ascertain whether the same protection
could be given to man which was observed in animals. For this purpose
it was essential to first of all prove the perfect harmlessness of the
operation. This was established by very careful observations of medical
men and scientists who were inoculated in Europe soon after the results
of the above investigations were published. The inoculation causes a
rise of temperature and general discomfort, which lasts one or two days,
and some pain at the seat of the injection, which disappears in a few
days. The fever and discomfort induced are, on the whole, shorter in
duration, though often more intense, than those caused by vaccination
against smallpox. The effect disappears within a few days and the individual
returns to his usual condition of health.</p>

<p>The next and all-important stage was to devise an experiment or a
series of experiments on man so as to test the efficiency of the method
against cholera attacks. This part of the investigation could only be
done in a cholera-stricken country, where opportunities would arise of
comparing the incidence of the disease in inoculated and uninoculated.
Such opportunities are limited. Except in certain parts of India and
China, cholera appears in localities unexpectedly and does not last long.
In the places where the disease is endemic the cases are scattered over
large areas. These features rendered the demonstration of the effect
of the vaccine a matter of particular difficulty. In 1893 I went to
India, and in the course of a year inoculated some twenty-three thousand
people in the northern parts of the country; but no cholera appeared
in their midst to show whether the vaccine was of value or not.
In the spring of 1894 the inoculations were introduced into Bengal,
and, with the assistance and co-operation of Prof. W.&nbsp;J. Simpson, of
King’s College, London, at that time Health Officer of Calcutta, and
of his staff, efforts were made to induce the inhabitants of the <i>bustees</i>
of Calcutta to get themselves inoculated. These bustees are isolated
villages consisting of groups of mud huts inhabited by the poorer class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Owing to the consumption of water from the ponds or tanks belonging
to these villages, the inhabitants of the bustees are subject to periodic
visitations of cholera. It was in one of these bustees that the first
observation was made as to the effect of the cholera vaccines.</p>

<p>The spring is essentially the cholera season in Calcutta. About the
end of March two fatal cases of cholera and two cases of choleraic
diarrhœa occurred in Katal Bagan Bustee, in a population grouped
around two tanks. This outbreak led to the inoculation of one
hundred and sixteen persons in the bustee out of about two
hundred. After the inoculation there occurred nine more cases of
cholera, seven of which proved fatal, and one case of choleraic diarrhœa.
All the ten cases occurred among the uninoculated portion of
the inhabitants, which formed the minority, none of the inoculated
suffering. The results were more interesting when analyzed in detail.
Some of the cases had occurred in families in which some of the members
had been inoculated and others not, and the disease selected the
non-inoculated members, sparing the inoculated. Thus, in one house
six members out of eight had been inoculated. The attack, a fatal one,
occurred in one of the remaining two. In another house eleven members
out of eighteen were inoculated. The eleven members remained
free while four out of seven not inoculated were attacked.</p>

<p>Upon these observations the Calcutta municipality felt encouraged
to vote funds for the continuance of the inoculations in an experimental
farm, and appointed for that purpose a special staff. In 1896
the result of two years’ observations were embodied by the health
officer in a report to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. It recorded
a most satisfactory state of affairs. During the time under observation
some eight thousand persons were inoculated. Cases of cholera occurred
in seventy-seven huts in which some members of the family
had been previously inoculated and others not. Comparing the incidence
of the disease in the two groups, a striking advantage was found
to be with the inoculated. I made an analysis of the cases according
to the time which had elapsed between inoculation in each of these huts
and the occurrence of cholera in them, and the following results were
found. During the first four days after inoculation, apparently before
the vaccine had time to produce its full protective effect, there were
proportionately 1.86 times fewer deaths among the inoculated than
among the non-inoculated members of the families. In a second period,
extending from the fifth to the four hundred and twenty-ninth day&mdash;i. e.,
for fourteen months&mdash;there were 22.62 times fewer deaths among
the inoculated; while in the last period&mdash;that is, between the four
hundred and thirtieth and seven hundred and twenty-eighth day after
the inoculation&mdash;there were only 1.54 fewer deaths among the inoculated,
the immunity having evidently gradually disappeared. The net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
result was that for two years after inoculation, including the periods
of incomplete protection, there was a reduction in mortality of 72.47
per cent among the inoculated; or in other words, in houses in which
inoculations were performed and in which cholera subsequently occurred
there were, even from the day of inoculation, before the full
effect of it could be produced, eleven deaths among the non-inoculated
to only three among the inoculated. Eight lives out of every eleven
were saved.</p>

<p>At the end of my first cholera campaign, in August, 1895, there
were altogether 31,056 natives of India, 125 Eurasians, 869 Europeans
of the civil population, 6,627 native officers and sepoys, and
294 officers with 3,206 men of the British troops stationed in India,
in all 41,787 people, who had submitted to inoculation. Observations
instituted among them, especially among prisoners, soldiers and
coolies in tea estates, with regard to whom detailed records could be
kept, went to confirm the results as detailed above. In order to
lengthen, if possible, the period of immunity, the plan was formed of
inoculating stronger vaccines and in higher doses. The inoculations
are now carried on in a Government laboratory, in Purulia, Bengal,
chiefly among the people emigrating to the cholera districts of Assam,
and there is no doubt that in the course of time a marked effect upon
the prevalence of cholera in those districts will be produced and valuable
theoretical data will be obtained.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There was one noticeable feature about the results of the inoculation
against cholera which early attracted my attention, and this was that
while the number of attacks and the absolute number of deaths was
strikingly influenced by the operation, the proportion of deaths to those
attacked did not appear to be changed. The case incidence was effectively
checked, but the ‘case mortality’ was not reduced. The inoculation
diminished the chances of an attack of cholera&mdash;that is, the
chances of the cholera virus penetrating into the tissues of a man; but if
it so happened that the patient was attacked and the virus found an
entrance and started growing in the system notwithstanding the inoculation,
the latter would not assist in mitigating the severity of the
symptoms or reducing the fatality of the disease. In analyzing this
result further, it seemed to me permissible to assume that the vaccine
protected against the cholera microbes themselves, but did not protect
against their poisonous products, which are the cause of the actual
symptoms.</p>

<p>This interpretation of the facts found support in a set of laboratory
experiments by Professor Pfeiffer and Dr. Kolle, of Koch’s Institute, in
Berlin, who showed that the blood serum of animals and persons inoculated
with the cholera vaccine, as practiced in India, acquired an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
intense power of destroying cholera microbes, but exhibited no properties
capable of counteracting the effect of their toxic products&mdash;no
‘antitoxic properties’. Combined with those of previous experimenters
these results tended to prove that two kinds of immunity could be
produced separately, and it became incumbent to devise a plan which
would secure not only a lowering of susceptibility to the disease, but
also a reduction in the case mortality.</p>

<p>For that purpose it seemed rational to attempt the treatment with
a vaccine containing a combination of bodies of microbes, together with
their toxic products. I intended to test this plan experimentally in
the cholera districts; but, plague having broken out in Bombay, the
Government of India commissioned me to inquire into the bacteriology
of that disease, and I determined that the knowledge gained in the
cholera inoculations should be applied and tested in the preparation
of a prophylactic against the new epidemic.</p>

<p>The experiments I had in view involved manufacturing a material
on a large scale, and operating on it for weeks continuously. To do
this it was essential to find a way of recognizing plague growth with
certainty, so as to enable the officers engaged in the manufacture to
control the process and know exactly when they were handling the
proper stuff, and when an admixture and invasion of extraneous growth
took place. When this was solved, a drug was prepared by cultivating
the plague microbe in sterilized broth, to which a small quantity
of clarified butter or of cocoanut oil had been added. The plague
bacilli attach themselves to the drops of butter or oil floating on the
surface, and grow down into the depth of the liquid, forming a peculiar
threadlike appearance. While doing so they secrete toxic matter,
which is gradually accumulated in the liquid; at the same time a large
amount of microbial growth comes gradually down from the surface of
the liquid and collects at the bottom of the flask. When shaken up
the whole represents the desired combination of the bodies of microbes
and of their toxic products. The process is continued for a period
of five to six weeks. As the microbes of plague had been very little
studied before, and as their exact effect on the human system was
unknown, I decided not to use for the treatment living microbes, but
to use at least at first ‘carbolized’ vaccines, though the result of the
treatment might be less favorable or less lasting than that which could
be expected from living vaccines. The microbes in the above plague
growth were accordingly killed by heating them at a temperature
ranging from 65° to 70° C., and then mixed with a small proportion
of carbolic acid, to prevent the drug from subsequent contamination
and decomposition. The dose of the prophylactic was regulated by
measuring up the quantity to be injected. The requisite amount is
determined by the degree of fever which it produces. The febrile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
reaction varies in different individuals, but a temperature reaching 102°
and above in at least thirty per cent of those inoculated has been found
to indicate a good material. In the cholera, rabies and smallpox
vaccines, the microbes being employed in a living state, it was essential
to fix the strength of the vaccine, for otherwise it was impossible to
predict the behavior of the microbe when injected into the system.
In the case of the plague prophylactic the activity of the microbes
is arrested before it is inoculated, and the effect can be regulated, as
mentioned above, by simply measuring up the doses in the same way
as is done with any chemical drug.</p>

<p>The expectation formed when devising the plan for the plague
prophylactic has been very fortunately justified, and an advance on the
results from the cholera vaccines was obtained; but I can not yet say
certainly whether this favorable result is indeed due to the particular
provisions which I had made for obtaining it.</p>

<p>The effect of the plague prophylactic was first tested at the Byculla
Jail, in Bombay, when the epidemic reached that establishment. From
the first day after the inoculation till the end of the outbreak there
were in the jail twelve cases and six deaths among one hundred and
seventy-two uninoculated inmates, and two cases, with no deaths, among
one hundred and forty-seven inoculated. A year later, almost exactly a
similar result was observed when the plague attacked the so-called
Umarkhadi Common Jail, in Bombay. In this case after the inoculation
there were ten cases and six deaths among one hundred and twenty-seven
uninoculated inmates, and three cases, with no deaths, among
one hundred and forty-seven inoculated. These and other observations
show that the vaccine for the plague begins to exercise its effect within
some twenty-four hours after inoculation; that it is useful even in the
case of persons already infected; that it is therefore applicable at any
stage of an epidemic. Numerous further observations were soon collected
on the working of the system.</p>

<p>At the small village of Uudhera, of the Baroda feudatory state,
where plague broke out, inoculation was applied to a half of each
family, the other half remaining uninoculated. After that there were
twenty-seven cases and twenty-six deaths among sixty-four uninoculated,
and eight cases, with three deaths, among seventy-one inoculated
of the same households, the proportionate difference in mortality being
over eighty-nine per cent. There followed observations on a far
larger scale, demonstrating that the mortality of the inoculated, compared
to that of the non-inoculated, was on an average between eighty
and ninety per cent less. Sometimes this reduction reached ninety
per cent. In the Punjaub, in a village called Bunga, there occurred, in
two hundred and eighty-one not inoculated, ninety-seven cases of
plague and sixty-five deaths, while among seventy-four inoculated there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
were six cases, but no deaths. In Bangalore, among 80,285 of the inhabitants
not inoculated, there were 2,208 deaths from plague, while
among 23,537 inoculated there were only 108. The observations at
Lanowli, Kirkee, Daman, Hubli, Dharwar, Gadag, in the Bombay
Presidency, gave the same results. At Hubli over forty-two thousand
inhabitants out of some fifty thousand were inoculated. In Bombay
city, out of a population of 821,764, 157,256 have now undergone the
inoculation. The work proceeds here at present at the rate of one
thousand to eleven hundred inoculations a day.</p>

<p>From plague hospitals the returns show that among those of the
attacked who were previously inoculated the mortality is reduced to less
than one half of that among patients who were not inoculated. The
property of reducing the case mortality thus appears to belong to the
plague prophylactic in an unmistakable degree.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>By the anti-cholera and anti-plague inoculation the methods of preventive
treatment by means of cultivated bacteria and their products
have been rendered, so to say, a part of the daily policy in human
medicine. The usefulness and practicability of those methods have
become clearly apparent, and steps have been taken to extend further
the field of their application. On the ground of the experiments made
with the typhoid bacillus in the Pasteur Institute in 1889&ndash;’93, and of
the results obtained from the anti-cholera inoculation in India, I was
able to induce Professor Wright, of the Pathological Laboratory in
Netley, whom I initiated in 1892 in the principles and technique
of anti-cholera inoculation, to start a campaign of similar operations
against typhoid among the British troops. The latter are stationed
at different times of their service very nearly in all parts of the world,
and yearly pay a very heavy tribute to that disease. The medical
officers in charge of these troops pass through a course of training at
Netley, and Professor Wright had rendered excellent services in connection
with the cholera inoculations, by disseminating the knowledge
of them among the probationers of the school. It seemed to
me expedient, therefore, to start the typhoid inoculation also through
the staff and pupils of that school. The following plan as to the preparation
of the vaccine, and the way of carrying out the inoculation,
was laid before Professor Wright. The typhoid bacillus was to be
brought to a fixed stage of virulence by the inoculation in the peritoneal
cavity of Guinea pigs, according to the exact rules prescribed for the
anti-cholera inoculation. Once the virus was fixed, it was to be cultivated
for twenty-four hours on a solid medium, and a first vaccine
prepared by carbolizing that virus. As, however, the durability of the
effect of carbolized vaccine alone was not known, this was to be followed
up by the injection of a dose of the fixed living virus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
The inoculation was first to be made on volunteers among the
physicians on probation at Netley; then on volunteers among the
young officers of the army on the eve of their departure for the tropics;
and then, with the approval of the military authorities, on volunteers
among private soldiers. At the end of 1895, during my visit to England,
I obtained from Sir William Mackinnon, then Director-General
of the Army Medical Department, permission for Professor Wright to
start the work upon the plan above detailed; and the first inoculations,
in the way described above, were done in the middle of 1896. Soon
after that, Pfeiffer and Kolle, recognizing the same similarity between
the cholera and typhoid microbes, and pointing out that the results
obtained by us in India were likely to be repeated when applying the
method to typhoid, proposed and started a similar series of inoculations.</p>

<p>When the inoculation against plague was begun, and observation
showed that dead vaccines alone were apparently sufficient to produce
satisfactory results, a second inoculation with living virus appeared
less urgently necessary; and as the effect of such an inoculation, which
Professor Wright very courageously tried first on himself, seemed
troublesome, it was decided to do for the time being the second
inoculation also with the carbolized virus. Similarly, the plan which
was adopted for the plague inoculation, of cultivating the vaccine in a
liquid, instead of a solid medium, and of using cultures of several
weeks’ duration, has been subsequently adopted in the typhoid inoculation
also.</p>

<p>Many thousands of British soldiers and civilians have already undergone
the inoculation in question. The latter was done partly with
vaccines cultivated on a solid medium, according to the older plan,
and partly with vaccines prepared according to the plague inoculation
method. The results so far observed are encouraging, and, I hope,
will shortly be improved considerably. At the last Harveian dinner
in London, Surgeon-General Jameson, Director-General of the Army
Medical Department, summarized the results of the observations in
India, where, among several thousands of young soldiers, the most
prone to the disease, the incidence of typhoid since their inoculation
was 0.7 per mille, while among the older, more resistant, not inoculated
soldiers, the incidence was during the same period just double that.
A large proportion of the force now on service in the South African
campaign have been inoculated, some before embarking and others
on their way out.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Such is the position of preventive inoculation, as applied, so far,
to human communities. The very success of these operations is now
apt to create some sort of feigned or earnest alarm, and one meets
at present with the question, What is going to happen to our poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
body if we are to be inoculated against <i>all</i> diseases? and with this other
one, How do you expect us to make a <i>living</i> if you try to keep all of us
alive? The humorous form of these questions usually permits of their
dropping out of the conversation without a reply. The earnest answers
are, however, obvious. The efforts of the bacteriologists in combating
diseases are at present directed to a twofold aim: their prevention, by a
prophylactic treatment, and their cure. The advantage of a curative
treatment is that it is to be applied to a relatively small number of persons,
to those who actually fall victims to an attack; while that of the
preventive treatment is in the greater certainty with which safety and
protection are secured by it. The relative position of the two treatments
will, in practice, differ in different diseases&mdash;namely, according to
the prevalence and fatality of a given disease, and according to the
merits of the two treatments as they stand at the time. In diseases in
which the risks of being attacked are smaller, or the consequences
of an attack less serious, or for which a very effective and sure curative
treatment has been discovered, the majority of people will prefer
to wait for an actual attack rather than to undergo the discomfort
of a preventive treatment; in diseases, on the contrary, in which the
chances of being attacked are great, or in which the fatality is higher,
the sequelæ of an attack more serious, and for which a successful and
not very troublesome preventive treatment has been found, large numbers
will undergo preventive inoculation. But, even in the latter case,
a mutual co-operation between the two methods will exist always, as
there will always be a number of people, either among those who have
neglected to protect themselves by inoculation, or among those in whom
the inoculation has proved unsuccessful, who will fall victims to an
attack and require the benefits of a curative treatment, be those at the
time little or great.</p>

<p>The answer to the second question is of course to be expected rather
from the politico-economist, the wise administrator, the civilian, than
from the bacteriologist. In any case it is clear already that if we are
ever to be told that we must thin our ranks, we shall prefer not to
leave the task in the hands of the indiscriminating microbe, but to
have some voice in the matter ourselves. Inoculation marks only the
conquest of another force which henceforth we shall be glad to control.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By</span> JAMES COLLIER.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> growth of the relations between a colony and the mother country
closely follows the development of the relationship between
an organism and its offspring, or (in higher species) between parents
and children. When an infusorian subdivides into two cells, the new
cell produced swims away and henceforth leads an independent life.
Most of the Phœnician and most of the earlier Greek colonies were
social infusoria which parted from the parent organism by segmentation
and had no further relations with it. As we rise in the animal
scale a new relationship, that between mother and young, and a new
instinct, the maternal, come into existence. These begin as low down
as the mollusks, and expand and heighten, though not without strange
lapses, in both insects and birds as species develope; but we need not
trace the evolution here. Let it suffice to note that there are successive
degrees of specialization; a site is chosen suitable for depositing and
hatching eggs; means are found for making them secure; a shelter
is built for them; they are deposited near substances adapted to nourish
the young; special food is prepared for them; they are reared through
food disgorged or brought to them. The accession of the male to the
family marks the dawn of the paternal instinct; it appears earliest
among fishes. This evolution is repeated in the history of colonies,
where, however, the maternal and paternal offices melt into one another
insensibly.</p>

<p>The mother country founds and nurtures colonies. Most of the
earliest colonies are the work of adventurous bands or navigating
merchants or fishermen, who seek their own habitats, carry with
them their own equipment and fight their own battles. Then the
metropolis settles its surplus or discontented citizens in territories
previously chosen, provides them with all that is necessary for
their start, and often nourishes them during the infancy of the
colony. Hispaniola was a state colony manned with miners and
artisans who were provided with tools, and this at the cost of
a loan and a draught from the confiscated property of the Jews.
Nor was it until gold began to be found in large quantities that the
receipts equalled the expenditure on the young colony. Louisiana was
founded and fostered with a royal munificence that conferred on it
“more than was contributed by all the English monarchs together for
the twelve English colonies on the Atlantic.” Georgia was a one-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
foundation, but the British Parliament twice granted considerable
sums to initiate it and carry it on; the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel aided, and the benevolence of philanthropic England contributed
largely to its success. Not till 1818&mdash;more than half a century
after the conquest&mdash;did the revenue of Canada balance its expenditure.
The convict colony of New South Wales was, of course,
entirely of state origin. Stores of every kind, together with cattle and
seeds, were sent out at the beginning, and long continued to be sent out
to it. The first governor was granted a space of two years to make it
self-supporting, but the growth of a convict colony is abnormally slow,
and the civil and military establishments for thirty-four years continued
to be a drain on the British exchequer to the extent of over ten millions.
Even now one of the oldest and best of existing British colonies, with
an area of over three hundred thousand square miles, does not produce
the breadstuffs needed for its own consumption. The Cape of Good
Hope, of mixed Dutch and French origin, was first made a truly
British colony by the dispatch of six thousand emigrants at the cost
of the mother country&mdash;a cost much greater than was anticipated.
When the Transvaal was forcibly annexed by England, the stepmother
country advanced a sum of £90,000 to rescue the quondam republic
from its financial difficulties. In 1895 Parliament voted three millions
for the building of a railroad in British East Africa. Uganda is supported
by a British subsidy. Algeria is a manufactured colony, which
has all along had to be supported by its creator. Apart from the cost
of their civil and military establishments, France has to subsidize her
colonies to the extent of over four millions sterling, partially expended
in reproductive public works. Even tiny New Caledonia costs France
half a million, one half of which, it is true, is expended on the convict
establishment.</p>

<p>Most colonies at their beginning are burdensome to the mother
country. Years after its foundation South Australia fell into such embarrassment
that its governors had to draw on the imperial exchequer
for nearly a million. In 1834 the expenditure in Cape Colony was still
in excess of the revenue. Sierra Leone had to be aided by a parliamentary
grant year after year. No wonder the Colonial Office complained
that colonies were expensive to keep up. In German Africa
the revenue does not meet the expenditure. The Congo Free State
does not pay its way. On the other hand, Congo Française has a
substantial surplus. Western Australia was another exception to the
rule. There the Imperial Government announced that it would contribute
nothing to the foundation of the colony, which was to be self-supporting
from the first. Private capitalists were to arrange for the
emigration of ten thousand persons in four years. Lands were granted
to the emigrants on a scale of extravagance which long hampered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
progress of the colony. Companies likewise expend large sums in many
colonies. French and English companies embarked on American, Indian,
African and island adventures at ruinous loss. Law’s company
withdrew from Louisiana, the New Zealand Company from New Zealand,
and the Canterbury Association from Canterbury with a balance
on the wrong side of the account. Wealthy individuals bear their part.
Mr. Rhodes annually subsidizes the British Central African Protectorate,
and King Leopold the Congo Free State. Colonial bishoprics
have also been endowed and colonial cathedrals built, largely with the
aid of voluntary contributions by sympathizers in the mother country.</p>

<p>The mother state sometimes gives the colonies the benefit of her
financial good name. In 1869 England withdrew her regiments from
New Zealand when the colony was still at war with the Maoris, and
to salve the wounded feelings of the colonists she agreed (under pressure)
to guarantee a loan of a million in aid of emigration and public
works. Before the Canadian Pacific Railway could be completed the
Imperial Government had to guarantee a loan of £3,600,000. Mr.
Rhodes proposes (unsuccessfully, it now appears) that the Imperial
Government, which contributed £200,000 to the cost of a railway from
Kimberley to Buluwayo, should guarantee a loan of an enormous
amount for the continuation of the African trunk railway from Buluwayo
to Lake Tanganyika.</p>

<p>The mother country supports or aids its self-governing colonies
through its capitalists. In order to execute public works&mdash;roads,
bridges and railways&mdash;to assist immigration, to build fortresses, and
sometimes to pay the interest on previous loans, all the colonies have
habitual recourse to the British Stock Exchange. There are good
reasons for this. The colonies have little capital of their own, for all
their money has been used up from day to day. The English investor
has an almost unlimited amount&mdash;the savings mainly of one industrious
century&mdash;and he is prepared to lend it at a lower rate of interest than
would content the colonial capitalist. Of over two thousand millions
sterling which John Bull has out at usury all over the world, the total
public and private indebtedness of the seven Australasian colonies
alone, with a population of four millions, is stated to exceed three hundred
and twenty millions, or at the rate of eighty pounds per head of
these daring colonists. One half of this sum is due from colonial
governments for the purposes already named. The half of it, due from
banks, building companies, mercantile associations and mortgage
agencies, excites no misgivings; these institutions can always go bankrupt,
as many of them did in the financial collapse of 1891&ndash;’93. But
it is not open to a British colony to file its schedules, or at least so we
used to think; and so the Times said till the oldest of British colonies
went bankrupt the other day. At all events, it is harder, and we contemplate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
this enormous pile of public indebtedness in young and scantily
peopled communities with the same feelings as made alarmists
foresee impending ruin in the growing augmentation of the gigantic
public debt of the United Kingdom. It is commonly said that while
the imperial debt has been accumulated as the cost of “just and necessary
wars,” or of wars that were neither just nor necessary, the colonial
debt has been contracted for the execution of reproductive public
works. This is not altogether so. Eleven million pounds of the public
debt of New Zealand were contracted to carry on war with the Maoris,
who were defending their territory. The Seven Years’ War, which was
begun on the part of England to gain possession of the Ohio Valley and
thus increase the extent of her colonies, doubled her public debt.
Where is the difference between the two classes of expenditure? Then
most of the self-governing colonies have expended large sums in fortifying
ports, some in partly supporting a fleet, and one at least in purchasing
war ships of its own. Nor has all the remainder been reproductively
expended. The building of schools is a wise way of spending
money, one’s own or another’s, but it can not be called a materially
reproductive way. Governors’ and ministerial residences, parliamentary
and departmental buildings, are indispensable, but they can not be
called ‘assets,’ especially if built of perishable and inflammable timber.
Even railways, most profitable of public works, are not always true
assets. In many of the colonies they are light railways, and when
traffic increases and a higher speed is required they will have to be built
over again and new rolling stock procured. Not a few of them, too,
are ‘political railways,’ running through a sparsely populated country
no-whither, and built to capture votes. Roads are only less valuable,
but they were made (sometimes by graduates and men of scientific antecedents
who were afterward cabinet ministers) at the wage rate of from
two guineas to four pounds ten per week, and are an inadequate return
on the outlay. Last century British loans were issued as prizes to
friends of ministers, and a much reduced amount found its way to the
treasury. Deduct an analogous, though not quite similar, item of waste
in colonial loans, add this to all the other non-reproductive elements,
and the genuinely reproductive proportion will shrink considerably.
Every one of the colonies, even with the fee simple of territories only
less than Europe in extent in their hands, would have sunk under the
increasing burden. Happily or not, the ever-growing wealth of England
has so cheapened money that the interest charge on the whole
Australasian indebtedness sank in five years (1890&ndash;’96), mainly through
conversion of loans, from fourteen millions to twelve and a quarter.
It may be added that the colonies which have borrowed most recklessly
have not been the most populous or those with largest resources, but
rather the socialistic colonies with big schemes on hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
A father may assist his son by supplying him with the capital needed
to carry on his business. Thus it is entirely with the mother country’s
money that the first colonial banks are founded. As the colony grows
wealthier and the business of the banks extends, colonial shareholders
purchase stock in it, but the number of British shareholders remains
considerable. A typical example is that of the Bank of New Zealand,
from two fifths to one half of whose shares are (or in 1888 were) held
in the United Kingdom. In the older or wealthier colonies of New
South Wales and Victoria the number of English shareholders may be
smaller, though still large. A still larger proportion of the shares of
the great colonial steamship companies, amounting possibly to three
fourths or nine tenths of the whole, is held (chiefly by commercial men
and firms) in Great Britain. Many commercial undertakings in all the
colonies are engineered entirely by English capital (not included in the
two thousand millions). The Canadian transcontinental railway; railways,
electric tramway lines and silver mines in Tasmania; the Midland
Railway and also copper mines in New Zealand; the gold mines in
Western Australia to such an extent that much more English capital is
said to pour into that colony than gold flows out of it&mdash;are only a few
colonial enterprises that would never have been undertaken but for
the mother country’s aid. Some of these are lucrative, others not;
some have been abandoned, and others belong to a still darker class.
“Uncounted millions of capital have been raised in the central money
market of London, only to be fooled away in ill-conceived and misdirected
enterprises abroad,” says Lord Brassey. Nor are the losses
confined to questionable undertakings. Two great Australasian banks
have frittered away their entire capital of four and three millions, respectively,
and it may be assumed that the British investor has borne
one half of the losses. Of half a dozen smaller colonial banks a similar
tale might be told. Father and son have to share in one another’s
adversity, as in one another’s prosperity.</p>

<p>The socialistic movement in England has lately so strongly reacted
on the relations of the Imperial Government with the colonies that the
Secretary of State is believed to be willing to employ the resources of
the empire to assist backward colonies. He has invited English capitalists
to aid the declining West Indies, and a leading firm has offered to
invest a million in the sugar industry if a guarantee of sufficient returns
is given. The constitution of the projected Australian Federation
contains a novel analogous provision, permitting the commonwealth to
aid its needy provinces. The growing unity in the social organism as a
whole is accompanied by an increasing unity in its component parts.</p>

<p>The mother country continues to defend its colonies, as animals
defend their young and parents their children. But the polyp does
not defend its offspring, nor did the earliest colonizing powers succor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
their colonies. While not even the armed persuasion of Cambyses
could induce Tyre to make war against Carthage, neither seems to
have helped the other in its need. Carthage fought savagely for
her Sicilian colonies, but in her own interests, not in theirs. Though
the ties between a Greek metropolis and her colonies were closer, the one
did not invariably defend the other. Corcyra refused the aid her
daughter city Epidaurus sought, and the latter had to find it in the
grandmother city of Corinth, who considered it <i>her</i> colony no less than
that of Corcyra. The Dorian city was celebrated for her typical
Greek patriotism, and she gladly assisted Syracuse to expel her Carthaginian
conquerors. Rome fought for her colonies while her power
lasted. France and England fought for their colonies, or rather for the
possession of them, all through the eighteenth century. Spain has just
fought for her last colonies, but as much against the colonists as against
the foreign state that came to set them free. The mother country is
also at the cost of keeping her colonies in a state of defence. The
sum of £9,000 was in 1679 annually expended on the maintenance of
English soldiers in Virginia and two West Indian colonies, and £1,000
on the fortifications of New York. Troops were often dispatched to assist
the American colonies in special expeditions. The colonial military
expenditure of Great Britain in 1859 amounted to nearly £1,200,000.
In compliance with the findings of a Royal Commission, repeatedly reaffirmed
by resolutions of Parliament, to the effect that the self-governing
colonies ought to suffice for their own military defense, the troops
were finally withdrawn in 1873, but she still maintains a garrison at
Halifax and in Natal and a fleet in Australian waters, to which last the
adjacent colonies contribute a fraction. Most of the self-governing
colonies have at their own cost erected fortresses, and they maintain a
defensive force. Two of them have stationary ships of war. They are
willing and eager, moreover, to aid the mother country when she is in
difficulties. When England was embroiled in Egypt or danger threatened
in India and South Africa, several of these colonies offered to send,
and one actually sent, troops to engage in wars in which they were not
directly concerned. The head and the extremities are sometimes at
variance because their interests conflict. The heart of such an empire
is one. A stride has been taken toward organic unity.</p>

<p>Animals evolve special organs for the nursing of their young, and
all colonizing countries seem to have created special departments
for the supervision of their colonies. As the lacteal glands are only
modified skin-glands, are in certain lower genera (the Monotremata)
at first without teats and only in higher species develop into true
mammæ, so the colonial department in the mother country is
originally a mere adaptation of existing agencies. A rather perfect
example of this stage is presented by the earliest of modern colonizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
powers. The Casa de la Contratacion de las Indias, established soon
after the discovery of South America, was organized in 1503. It granted
licenses, equipped and despatched fleets, received merchandise for export
and cargoes imported and contracted for their sale. It controlled
the trade with Barbary and the Canaries and supervised the shipping
business of Cadiz and Seville. Taking cognizance of all questions
concerning marine trade, it was advised by two jurists. It also kept the
Spanish government informed of all that concerned the colonies. It
was a general board of colonial marine trade, and such it remained
even when, a few years later, its more important colonial functions
were absorbed by a higher department.</p>

<p>Where the colony has been founded by a commercial or by a colonizing
company, the mother country controls the colony through the
directors of the company; the office of the company is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tanto</i> the
Colonial Office. Yet the later colonial department, as an organ of
government, is not a development of these shipping, commercial or
colonizing boards. It is a delegation of the sovereign authority. This
is at first exercised directly by the sovereign as it was notably by
Isabella and Ferdinand. It is next delegated, like almost all functions
of the ruler, to his privy council, which assigns the business of colonies
to a committee, which again may be set apart as an independent
administrative body. The Spanish Council of the Indies, the separate
English privy council for colonial affairs contemplated in the first Virginian
charter, the Council of Nine appointed by the States-General
of the Netherlands, the Swedish royal council, were such bodies. Their
powers are everywhere the same. The superintendence of the whole
colonial system is entrusted to them. They have supreme jurisdiction
over all the colonies. They appoint and may recall viceroys, governors-general,
governors and other local officers. They can veto laws and
ordinances made by colonial rulers or legislatures. They frame constitutions
for the colonies and enact laws. Through the governors
and other officers sent out by them, they minutely supervise and incessantly
interfere with the whole internal administration of each colony.
The tendency of this supreme council is to divorce itself evermore
from the privy council and become independent, till at last it
is transformed into a ministerial department. Yet an amicable relationship
(such as sometimes survives the divorce court) long remains.
The Colonial Committee of the privy council in England was summoned
as late as 1849, and the Judicial Committee still hears appeals
from colonial courts of justice. The government of the commonwealth
was naturally averse to the king’s council, and a body of
special commissioners (Cromwell and Pym and Vane among them)
was appointed to govern the colonies.</p>

<p>The Restoration did not at once return to the old system. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
contrary, a remarkable democratic advance was made. Recognizing
that though ‘politics lie outside the profession of merchants’ (as the
Swedish and British governments declared), yet trade is eminently
within their scope, the restored monarchy set up a Council of Trade
and Plantations, of whose forty members twenty were elected representatives
of the five merchant companies and the incorporated trades.
But there was ever a tendency, at least under the despotic rule of the
Stuarts, to revert to the privy council, and in 1674 a standing committee
of it was appointed Lords of the Committee of Trade and Plantations.
The change appears to have been unimportant. Trade still
governed the committee and shaped its policy.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade set up in 1696, rather by the House of Commons
than by the Ministry, marked the more popular character of the
revolution of 1688, and lasted for ninety years. As if foreshadowing the
despotic character of the English reaction against the greater French
revolution, this board was abolished by an act introduced by the chief
reactionary&mdash;Edmund Burke. A committee of the Privy Council for
Trade and Plantations was in 1786 again resorted to, and this committee
in a shadowy manner survived (perhaps it still survives) till 1849, when
it was for the last time summoned by Earl Grey. But the real administration
of the colonies had long been in the hands of a department of
state, directly responsible to Parliament, though it was still a department
that dealt with other affairs as well. Specialization began in 1702 by the
colonies being assigned to the Secretary for the Southern Department.
In 1768 a separate department with a secretary was created for America,
where almost all of the colonies were then situated. After the loss of
most of the American colonies the new department was abolished in
1782. The colonies were then annexed to the home department. In
1794 the newly created war department nominally included the colonies,
though these were not actually united with it till the Committee for
Trade and Plantations ceased to act, seven years later. In 1854 a
separate colonial department, with an independent secretary of state,
was finally <span class="locked">created.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> The history of the relations between the government of Great Britain and her colonies will
be found in many books, but best in Mr. Egerton’s comprehensive survey of British colonial
policy.</p></div>

<p>As there were twenty-three secretaries in forty-one years, it will
be readily understood that the practical work of administration remained
with the permanent officials. With a longer tenure of office,
previous training and thorough mastery of details, they held all the
threads of colonial administration in their own hands. A newly-appointed
minister, with little knowledge of the colonies and no acquaintance
at all with the business of his department, was no match
for an experienced officer who had colonial affairs at his fingers’ ends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
A mere clerk, unknown outside his office, though well known in
literature, could recall a governor; another, whose very name was
unknown till he died, recommended (that is, commanded on pain of
dismissal) a recent Governor of New Zealand to give away to his
ministers on a crucial exercise of the prerogative.</p>

<p>Nor is it in matters of routine alone that the permanent officers
shape the course of colonial administration. A strong-minded minister
with a policy of his own, like Lord Grey or Lord Carnarvon, will force
his subordinates to carry it out, but even here a still stronger-minded
under-secretary will often have his way. In 1848 Lord Grey, then
Secretary for the Colonies, summoned the aged and moribund Committee
(of the privy council) on Trade and Plantations to advise with
him on the policy to be adopted towards the Australian colonies. The
report was drafted by Sir James Stephen and we have no difficulty in
discovering in its far-sighted proposals and masculine style the mind as
well as the hand of the author of the essay on ‘Hildebrand.’ It is often
said that a state department is inevitably wedded to routine. In the
report just mentioned the striking feature is the outline of a system of
Australian federation that is only now on the point of being realized.
So far was the pedantic Colonial Office then, as it has often been before
and since, ahead of its subject colonies.</p>

<p>The other colonizing countries have followed the same line of development.
Beginning as direct delegations of the sovereign power to a
branch, first constituent and then separated, of the sovereign’s council,
the department of colonies has been in course of time made an independent
ministry directly answerable to parliament. In bureaucratic
France the colonies since 1854 have been associated with the navy. On
the first of January, 1899, the empire on which the sun never set,
having lost the last of the dependencies that were once its glory,
abolished its colonial office. The sun had set on Spain to rise no more.</p>

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor</span> GEORGE F. SWAIN.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the enormous progress in the arts and sciences which has
characterized especially the last half of the nineteenth century,
education has kept well abreast, although its progress has been gradual
and it is not always easy to recognize the great advances that
have been made. In the sciences, a discovery is made or a machine
invented that in the course of a few years forms the basis of a new
industry, gives occupation to thousands and places within the reach
of almost every one conveniences previously attainable only by the
few. In education no such sudden revolutions occur, and great changes
are introduced by degrees without producing any commotion or any
surprise. From the days of Erasmus and Rabelais, if not earlier, educational
reformers have urged the importance of studying things rather
than books about things, of cultivating the hand and eye as well as
the mind, of training the perceptive powers, of cultivating a habit of
observation and discrimination, and of developing the faculty of judgment.
Yet, notwithstanding all that has been said and written, progress
in this direction has until recently been very slow. Carlyle,
apparently looking at the matter almost from the old scholastic standpoint,
expressed the opinion that the true university of modern times
was a great library; books, not things, should be studied. It would
conform more to the modern point of view to say that the true university
of the twentieth century is a great laboratory. Even the function
of a library in our modern institutions of learning is perhaps more that
of a laboratory than that of a mere storehouse of facts and opinions.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not too much to say that the development in the
direction indicated has been greatest in our own country; that the
United States have taken the lead in the revolution against the old
method of teaching, and that at the present time the higher schools
of this country are examples of the best practice and the highest
development of the laboratory method. It may, therefore, be of interest
to give the readers of this magazine a brief account of the school
which has in these respects been one of the foremost, if indeed it
has not led the schools of this country, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rogers Building, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is at the right, the
Walker Building at the left.</span></div></div>

<p>With the development of the natural sciences and the growth of
the constructive arts, natural science long ago gained a place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
curricula of the great universities of Europe; and afterwards special
schools were founded for teaching the applications of science to the
arts. In France, the École des Ponts et Chaussées, originally started
in 1747 as a drawing school, was organized in 1760 for the training
of engineers. In the States of Germany, a number of similar schools
were organized early in the present century. In America, the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, the pioneer in technical education, was
founded in 1824, and was the only school devoted to applied science
until the forties, when Joseph Sheffield and Abbot Lawrence established
the schools which bear their names, in connection, respectively, with
Yale and Harvard. With the development of railroads, which dates
from the thirties, and of manufacturing, which began in this country
but a few years earlier, urgent need was felt for schools which should
fit younger men to grapple with the problems which the new industries
offered. These schools, however, maintained for many years but a
precarious existence and were quite elementary in character. The
Civil War interrupted their growth and absorbed for a time all the
resources of the nation; but its termination set free an abundant
store of energy, henceforward to seek its chief application in the
development of trade, commerce, manufacturing and industrial pursuits
of every kind. From this time the success of schools of technology
was assured. They were needed to supply young men for the
development of the arts; but, on the other hand, as in all things not
purely material, they were to create a demand for such men by first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
furnishing a supply. Manufacturers and leaders of industrial enterprise
soon found that they could not afford to do without the services
of young men trained in scientific principles. In this way, by reversing
the usual law of supply and demand, these schools contributed powerfully
to advance the technical development of the country, far indeed
beyond the measure that may be inferred from the mere number of
their graduates.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was chartered in 1861,
and first opened to students in 1865. Its claim to recognition as a
leader in the development of technical education may perhaps be
summarized as follows: It was the first school in the world to institute
laboratory instruction in physics and chemistry to students in large
classes as a part of the regular course of each candidate for a degree;
the first to equip a mining and metallurgical laboratory for the instruction
of students by actual treatment of ores in large quantities;
the first to establish a laboratory for teaching the nature and uses
of steam, and a laboratory for testing the strength of materials of
construction in commercial sizes; and the first in America to establish
a department of architecture. Later still, it was the first school in
America to establish distinct and specialized courses of study in electrical
engineering, in sanitary engineering, in chemical engineering
and in naval architecture.</p>

<p>The success of the school has been commensurate with its progressiveness.
It stands to-day the largest, most complete school of its class
in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. The number
of its students is 1,176, the number of its teachers, including lecturers,
175. Excluding lecturers, the number of students per teacher is only
8.7, a ratio which is a good general index of the character of the instruction.
The students come from 40 States and Territories of the
Union and from 12 foreign countries.</p>

<p>Before passing to a more detailed description of the work of its
various departments, some general characteristics of the school should
be mentioned. The first is the great variety of its courses and the
specialization of its instruction. It is a college of general technology,
embracing almost every branch of study which finds application in
the arts. There are thirteen distinct courses of study: Civil and
topographical engineering, mechanical engineering, mining engineering
and metallurgy, architecture, chemistry, electrical engineering,
biology, physics, general studies, chemical engineering, sanitary engineering,
geology and naval architecture. These several departments
mutually support and reinforce each other, and allow a specialization
of the instruction which would be impossible in a smaller college with
a less numerous staff of instructors. Thus, at the Institute of Technology,
there are not only professors of civil engineering and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
mechanical engineering, but professors of mechanism, steam engineering,
railroad engineering, highway engineering, hydraulic engineering,
topographical engineering, etc. Again, the chemical staff of twenty-four
persons is distributed over general chemistry, analytical chemistry,
organic chemistry, industrial chemistry and sanitary chemistry. There
are separate laboratories for water analysis, for gas analysis, for food
analysis, for dyeing and bleaching, etc. In each of these there are
teachers who are able to give their entire time to instruction and research
in a single line.</p>

<div id="ip_260" class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="images/illo_038.jpg" width="403" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">William Barton Rogers, President</span>, 1862&ndash;1870; 1878&ndash;1881.</div></div>

<p>The second characteristic of the Institute is the predominance of
laboratory, shop and field practice, experiment and research. These
are used wherever it is found practicable to supplement, illustrate or
emphasize the work of the recitation or lecture-room.</p>

<p>The third characteristic of the Institute, and one which is absent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
in the case of many similar schools, is the fact that a not inconsiderable
amount of general training has from the beginning been required of
every candidate for the degree. In some technical or scientific schools
there are no liberalizing studies, aside from those of a professional
character. The faculty of the institute have insisted that such studies
should be incorporated to a considerable extent in the curriculum of
every course, recognizing the fact that few students in technical schools
are graduates of colleges, and that the aim of the Institute should be
first of all to graduate broadly trained men. Aside from the courses
in liberal studies, a broad spirit is shown in the technical courses themselves.
The study of general principles is always the chief end in
view, and to it are strictly subordinated the acquirement of all knacks,
tricks of the trade or merely practical rules.</p>

<p>These characteristics of the Institute were impressed upon it from
the beginning by the master hand of its founder and first president,
William B. Rogers. President Rogers aimed to establish ‘a comprehensive,
polytechnic college’ which should provide a ‘complete system
of industrial education.’ It is now generally recognized that a complete
system of industrial education would consist of three parts: First,
manual training schools, for developing the eye and hand, not with
the object of producing artisans, but for training alone. Second,
trade schools for special training in the technique of the different
trades. Third, higher technical schools for training in the fundamental
principles of the sciences, and fitting men in the broadest way to become
leaders in the application of the sciences to the arts. Manual
training is now generally recognized as a desirable addition to every
scheme of public instruction and a powerful adjunct to every technical
school. It was not indicated in the original scheme of the Institute,
but was added in 1877 through the wisdom of President Runkle, as
a result of the exhibition in Philadelphia of the results obtained
in Russia by instruction of this kind. Trade schools, for the training
of artisans, were never included in the scheme of President Rogers,
and are not now, either in America or Europe, considered suitable
adjuncts to so-called technical schools, although they are very desirable
as special and independent institutions. The original plan for the
Institute contemplated simply a school of the last-named kind, together
with provision for evening lectures, to which outsiders should be admitted,
and which it was expected would be of benefit to artisans; and
also the establishment of a museum of arts, and of a society of arts
which should hold regular meetings and which should be the medium
for the communication to the public of scientific discoveries and inventions.
It may be as well to state here that the museum of arts
was never established except in so far as the separate departments of
the Institute have accumulated collections; but that the society of arts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
which held its first meeting in 1862, has been continued to the present
time. Many important inventions, as for instance the earliest forms
of the Bell telephone, were first publicly exhibited at its meetings.</p>

<p>In outlining his plan, President Rogers showed wonderful keenness
and foresight. With the added experience of the succeeding forty
years, it would scarcely be possible to make a more complete statement
of what experience has shown to be the best method of organization.
In fact, his Scope and Plan of the School of Industrial Science of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology may be said to be the first
step toward a new order of things in education, and contains the first
clear statement of the desirability of teaching physics, mining, metallurgy
and other branches by the laboratory method.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Henry L. Pierce Building and Engineering Building.</span></div></div>

<p>Let us now see what has been the result of the nearly forty years
of development since President Rogers outlined his plan. Originally
confined to one building, the growing needs of the school have led to
the erection of five others, in addition to a gymnasium. The original
building, completed in 1865, is now known as the Rogers Building, after
the founder of the school; while the one next erected, in 1883, is
named after the third president, the late General Francis A. Walker.
These two buildings each measure about 90 by 150 feet, and in addition
to a building occupied by the Boston Society of Natural History,
occupy one entire square nearly in the heart of the city, and in close
proximity to the Public Library and the Art Museum. Three other
buildings, which adjoin each other and now form one structure, are
situated about six hundred feet distant and form the front and part of
one side of what will some day be one large quadrangle. The first
of these buildings to be erected was the Engineering Building, built
in 1889, measuring 52 by 148 feet on the ground, adjoining which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
a building erected in 1892, 58 by 68 feet on the ground, and now
forming part of the Engineering Building. Adjoining this is the Henry
L. Pierce Building, erected in 1898, and measuring 58 by 160 feet. In
addition to these buildings are the workshops, about a quarter of a mile
distant, covering 24,000 square feet, and a gymnasium and drill hall.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">One of the Chemical Laboratories.</span></div></div>

<p>The first laboratory to be established at the institute was that of
chemistry, and this leads us to speak first of the department of chemistry.
The laboratory of general chemistry was opened in 1876 under
the direction of Professors <span class="locked">Eliot<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span> and Storer, and is believed to be
the first laboratory where instruction was given in general chemistry
to classes of considerable size. From small beginnings, this department
has rapidly grown under the able direction of such men as
James M. Crafts, (since 1897 president of the Institute), William Ripley
Nichols, Charles H. Wing, Lewis M. Norton and Thomas M. Drown,
until now the instructing force consists of five professors, thirteen
instructors and six assistants, a total teaching force of twenty-four, in
addition to seven or eight lecturers on chemical subjects. The department
occupies the two upper floors in the Walker Building, together
with about half of one floor in the Henry L. Pierce Building, devoted
to industrial chemistry. The laboratories, which are said to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
largest and best equipped in the United States, are known as the
Kidder chemical laboratories, having been so named in recognition of
the generosity of the late Jerome S. Kidder. They comprise twenty-two
separate laboratories, three lecture-rooms, a reading-room and
library, two balance-rooms, offices and supply-rooms, making forty
rooms in all, with accommodation for seven hundred students. Besides
the large laboratories for general chemistry and analytical chemistry,
there are smaller laboratories for volumetric analysis, for organic chemistry,
for sanitary chemistry with special reference to the analysis of
water and air, for oil and gas analysis, for the optical and chemical examination
of sugars, starches, etc., for the determination of molecular
weights, and so on. In the industrial laboratories, the students are
taught how to manufacture chemicals with due regard to economy of
material, space and time. There is also a special laboratory for textile
coloring, with printing machines and all the necessary equipment of
baths, dryers, etc., for experimental dyeing and coloring. In this laboratory
the preparation and use of coloring matters are taught with the
object of fitting young men for positions in dye works. A course of
lectures in textile coloring was first introduced in 1888 and the laboratory
course in 1889.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Now President Eliot of Harvard.</p></div>

<p>A large amount of original work is accomplished each year in these
laboratories, both by students and professors. During the year 1897&ndash;98,
for instance, four books and sixteen articles on chemical subjects came
from them. In the development of sanitary chemistry the Institute
has been particularly prominent. Beginning with the careful and
thorough investigations made by Professor Nichols for the State Board
of Health, the reputation of the institute in this direction has been
still further increased by the recent extensive investigations of Professor
Drown and Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, made for the same board in connection
with the examination of the purity of the water supplies of
the State, and the experiments at Lawrence relating to the best methods
for purifying water and disposing of the sewage of inland towns.</p>

<p>An illustration of the policy of the school in separating out a
subject whenever it is found capable of complete theoretical and practical
treatment and putting it into the hands of some assistant professor
for development, is found in the laboratory for gas and oil analysis,
which for some years has been in charge of Dr. Gill. In this laboratory,
investigations are made relating to chimney gases, as well as questions
of fuel, furnaces, gas firing, etc., while oils are tested and analyzed
with reference to specific gravity, viscosity, friction, flashing and firing
points, and liability to spontaneous combustion. The same policy is
further illustrated in the establishment in 1894 of a well equipped
laboratory devoted entirely to physical chemistry; that is to say, to the
relations between chemical changes and heat, light and electricity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
This laboratory, under the charge of Dr. H.&nbsp;M. Goodwin, occupies a
room measuring 28 by 29½ feet, and is devoted to photographic work,
experiments in electrical conductivity, thermo-chemistry, molecular
weight determinations and experiments in chemical dynamics. More
recently still, a complete option in electro-chemistry has been established,
to meet a growing demand.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Part of the Electrical Engineering Laboratory.</span></div></div>

<p>Still another illustration of the policy of specialization is afforded
by the action of the Institute in establishing new courses of study,
extending through the entire four years, whenever the need is felt for
men trained in a direction not hitherto specially provided for. Thus,
in 1888 a new course was established in chemical engineering. The
chemical engineer is not primarily a chemist, but a mechanical engineer&mdash;one,
however, who has given special attention to such problems as the
construction of dye works and bleacheries, sugar refineries, soap works,
paper and pulp manufactories, fertilizer works, chemical works, and
in general all the problems of chemical machinery and manufacturing.
That this new course filled a real want was soon made evident. The
first class, that of ’91, contained seven graduates, while eighty-eight
students in all have now been graduated and are for the most part
engaged in chemical works.</p>

<p>The physical laboratories of the Institute are now known as the
Rogers laboratories. Although they formed perhaps the central feature
of President Rogers’ plan, financial and other exigencies prevented
their being established when the school was opened. In 1869, Prof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Edward C. Pickering, then in charge of the department of physics,
submitted a scheme to the government of the Institute entitled ‘Plan of
the Physical Laboratory.’ This plan was adopted and carried out in
the autumn of 1869 and has been in use ever since. It is worthy of
remark that the original statement of Professor Rogers with reference
to laboratory instruction in physics contained no mention of electricity,
then a subordinate branch, but one whose development since has caused
it to occupy the leading place in any physical department. In 1882
the corporation established a course in electrical engineering, setting
an example which has since been followed by almost every large technical
school, and founding a course destined in a few years to become
one of the largest in the Institute.</p>

<p>At present the department of physics and electrical engineering,
under the head of Prof. Charles R. Cross, has an active teaching force
of one professor, four assistant professors, six instructors and three
assistants, a total of fourteen. In addition to these, there are twelve
lecturers on special topics, including many men eminent in their profession.
The Rogers laboratories occupy sixteen rooms in the Walker
Building, including two lecture-rooms and ten laboratories. As in
the case of the chemical department, these laboratories are highly
specialized. There is a laboratory for general physics, one for electrical
measurements, two rooms devoted to a laboratory for electrical engineering,
containing two distinct power plants driven by steam engines of
100 and 150 horse-power, with a large number of dynamo machines,
transformers and a great variety of other apparatus arranged for purposes
of instruction, the mere enumeration of which would occupy
several pages. Moreover, a lighting and power plant in the new
building on Trinity Place is available for experiments and instruction.
Besides these, there are rooms for photometry, for heat measurements,
for acoustics, for optics and for photography. In fact, probably no
department of the Institute is more fully equipped than this, the wealth
of apparatus being so great that the casual visitor is confused by the
network of wires and machinery which surround him.</p>

<p>The interdependent and harmonious work of the various departments
of the Institute is shown in the development of special lecture
and laboratory courses, and is in marked contrast to the policy of
departmental isolation sometimes practiced. Thus, in 1889, two new
courses of instruction were established by the physical department in
response to the demand of the department of mining; namely, the
course in heat measurements, including measurements of high temperatures,
the determination of the calorific power of fuels, etc., and a
course on the applications of electro-metallurgy to chemical analysis,
the reduction of ores and similar problems. The equipment of calorimeters,
pyrometers, etc., in the heat laboratory is said to be so large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
as to permit a more complete examination of the efficiency of fuels than
has hitherto been possible anywhere.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Smelting Furnace in John Cummings Laboratory of Mining and Metallurgy.</span></div></div>

<p>Perhaps the greatest innovation made by the Institute in the early
days was in establishing a laboratory for the teaching of mining and
metallurgy. Previous to 1871 metallurgical work was done in the chemical
laboratories, but in that year the mining and metallurgical laboratory
was put into operation through the efforts of President Runkle,
Professor Richards and Professor Ordway. Prior to this date, there
were assaying or metallurgical laboratories at the École des Mines at
Paris, the Royal School of Mines in London, the German Mining
Schools at Freiberg and Clausthal and Berlin, and also in several
technical schools in this country. The German mining schools were
situated beside smelting works, but the plants could not often be used
for experiments by professors or students in a way to alter the usual
method of running. In all these laboratories, however, the apparatus
was designed to treat quantities of ore not exceeding a few ounces for
each test. The Institute laboratories were the first in the world which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
were designed for the treatment of ores in economical quantities of
from five hundred pounds to three tons, and used entirely for purposes
of instruction. They are now known as the John Cummings laboratories,
in memory of one who for many years was treasurer of the
Institute and one of its most devoted friends. They now occupy the
entire basement of the Rogers Building, and include laboratories for
milling, concentrating and smelting ores, as well as for testing them by
assay and by blowpipe. The development of these laboratories from the
small beginnings of 1871 has been mainly due to the efforts of Prof.
R.&nbsp;H. Richards, past president of the American Institute of Mining
Engineers, whose contributions on methods of ore dressing are well
known to mining engineers. The staff of this department also includes
Prof. H.&nbsp;O. Hofman, well known for his researches in metallurgy.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Three Stamp Mill in Mining Laboratory.</span></div></div>

<p>Mention should here be made of the department of geology, which
is under the direction of Professors Niles, Crosby and Barton, and
which now occupies commodious quarters comprising the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of a floor in the Henry L. Pierce Building. The collections of this
department number many thousands, and are supplemented by those
of the Society of Natural History, which are available for purposes of
instruction. As would be expected in a school of applied science, the
economic aspects of geology are kept closely in view, and the work is
adapted to the particular object to be attained. The student in architecture,
for instance, receives a course in geology in which the study
of building stones is a prominent feature.</p>

<p>An engineering laboratory formed part of the original scheme of
President Rogers, although he included it under the head of physics
and did not anticipate the importance which has since attached to it.
Such a laboratory, especially devoted to engineering, was established on
a small scale in 1874, through the efforts of Professor Whitaker. An
engine for experimental purposes was presented to the institute by
Mr. G.&nbsp;B. Dixwell, and this, with other apparatus, constituted what is
believed to have been the first engineering laboratory in the world for
the regular instruction of classes. For lack of funds and space, it was
not much developed until 1882, but since that time it has been brought
to a high state of efficiency. To-day the engineering laboratories, as
they are called, which include laboratories of steam engineering,
hydraulics, for the testing of materials and a room containing cotton
machinery, occupy a floor space of 21,380 square feet on the two lower
floors of the Engineering and Pierce Buildings. In addition to this,
there are workshops which will be referred to again. It would be
tedious to enumerate the great variety of apparatus to be found in
these laboratories, but a few important points may be mentioned. In
the steam laboratory a 150 horse-power triple-expansion Corliss engine,
the first of its kind of practical size ever arranged for experimental
purposes, was purchased in 1890 and is regularly used for testing purposes.
A second engine of 225 horse-power was added two years ago,
transferring its power through a rope drive. Besides these two large
engines, there are a number of smaller ones for experimental purposes
and the study of valve setting, and, in addition, there are gas engines,
hot-air engines and other apparatus. There is also a collection of
cotton machinery sufficient to make clear to the student the mechanism
of the various machines.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Horizontal Emery Testing Machine of 300,000 Pounds Capacity in the Applied
Mechanics Laboratory.</span></div></div>

<p>The hydraulic laboratory is well equipped for the study of the laws
of flowing water, having a steel tank five feet in diameter and twenty-seven
feet high, with a system of stand-pipes eighty-five feet high,
reaching to the top of the building. This tank is furnished with gates
and other apparatus suitable for experiments on the flow from orifices,
and connected with a system of horizontal pipes by which a large
variety of other investigations may be carried on. Among the other
apparatus of interest may be mentioned two impact water wheels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
placed in housings with glass sides so that the action of the water on
striking the buckets can be observed.</p>

<p>Some experiments have already been made in the laboratory on the
flow of air, the results of which have been communicated by Professor
Peabody to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is now
intended to continue the study of the flow of air and its use as a
motive power in great detail, just as the flow of water is studied, and
an air compressor of 100 horse-power, which will produce a pressure
of twenty-five hundred pounds, is now being installed.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The 100,000 Pound Beam Machine in the Applied Mechanics Laboratory.</span></div></div>

<p>The laboratory for testing the strength of materials was established
in 1881 by Prof. G. Lanza, and has since been extensively developed
under his direction, until it is now one of the most complete in the
world. It is perhaps not too much to say that the experiments made
in this laboratory have in some respects revolutionized the ideas of
engineers. Previous to its establishment, the only tests of timber that
had been made were upon small selected specimens one or two inches
square and a few feet long. The results of these tests had been used
for years by architects and engineers, and they were given in all the
engineering handbooks. In the Institute laboratory there were conducted
the first systematic and extended tests of beams of commercial
size. The results soon showed that the strength of such timber was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
great deal less than previous tests on small beams had indicated, and
the practice of engineers and architects has since that time been completely
modified through the results obtained in this and similar laboratories.
In this way does the work of such a laboratory become of direct
and lasting value to the arts. The central piece of apparatus of the
Institute laboratory is the Emery machine, similar to the great machine
at the Watertown arsenal, with a capacity of three hundred thousand
pounds. But in addition to this machine there are a dozen or more
other machines designed to test beams, columns, rope, wire and, in fact,
materials of every kind and in every form. An interesting machine
is that for testing shafts in torsion, and it is instructive to see it twist
off with apparent ease a steel shaft three inches in diameter, twisting
the fibers before they break till the rod resembles a barber’s pole. There
are also beam-testing machines with capacities up to one hundred thousand
pounds, in which not only beams but wooden trusses may be tested
to the breaking point. Some of the apparatus is of great delicacy;
for instance, one instrument will measure the twist of a steel shaft two
and a half inches in diameter and six feet long so delicately that the
effect of a twist given by one’s hand is distinctly visible; scientifically
speaking, it will measure an angle of twist of two seconds. There is
also a machine designed for testing stone arches, having a capacity of
four hundred thousand pounds and suitable for an investigation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
many questions concerning these uncertain structures; also machinery
for studying the wear of brake shoes and wheel tires, a subject in regard
to which there is room for much investigation. Finally, mention
should be made of machinery for investigating the interesting subject
of the effect of repetition of stress.</p>

<div id="ip_272" class="figcenter" style="width: 548px;">
  <img src="images/illo_050.jpg" width="548" height="428" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Forge Shop.</span></div></div>

<p>The tests performed in the engineering laboratory cover almost the
entire range of mechanical science. Sometimes investigations are carried
on through a number of years; for instance, during three successive
years experiments were conducted and formed the subject of theses on
the proper method of counterbalancing the reciprocating parts of a
locomotive. Nor are the tests performed by the Institute students as
a regular part of their instruction confined to these laboratories, as is
made evident by the fifty-hour test of the West End Street Railway
power station and the twenty-four hour test of the pumping engine at
Chestnut Hill, both recently carried out.</p>

<p>In connection with the engineering laboratories, brief mention may
be made of the shops, which form an important adjunct of the laboratories.
They consist of a shop for carpentry, wood-turning and pattern-making,
equipped with forty carpenters’ benches, thirty-six pattern-makers’
benches and a full equipment of saws, planers, lathes, etc.; a
foundry with a cupola furnace for melting iron, thirty-two moulders’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
benches, two brass furnaces and a core-oven; a forge shop with thirty-two
forges, a power hammer, vises, etc.; a machine shop with about
forty lathes, together with drills, planers and all the other necessary
apparatus used in machine tool work.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the Institute laboratories is shown by the following
statements: The total horse-power of steam and other engines is
nine hundred and eighty-three; the total capacity of tension, compression
and transverse testing machines is over eight hundred thousand
pounds, and of torsion testing machines about one hundred and fifty-six
thousand inch pounds; the total horse-power of hydraulic motors is
sixty-two; and the total capacity of pumps is thirty-two hundred gallons
per minute.</p>

<p>The engineering laboratories are used by students of all the engineering
departments, that is to say, by a large majority of the students
in the school. The benefit derived by this actual contact with materials
and with machines of commercial size, under proper instruction, is
believed to be very great.</p>

<p>The department of mechanical engineering, one of the original
departments, is now the largest in the school, having a force of instruction
of five professors and twelve instructors and assistants. As an
offshoot of it, a department of naval architecture was established in
1893, after a preliminary experience of four years with an option in
this direction. This was the first course of its kind established in this
country. It is somewhat remarkable, considering the preëminence
that America has long enjoyed in the building of ships and marine
engines, that our technical schools should for so long have failed to
offer specialized instruction in these important branches. Schools devoted
to these subjects have long existed abroad. The French Government
School of Naval Architecture was established in 1865 for the
purpose of educating young men for the Government service. To this
school foreigners are admitted under certain restrictions. In England
the first school of naval architecture was opened in 1871, but no
systematic instruction seems to have been provided until 1864. At
present, however, the Royal Naval College, at Greenwich, gives excellent
and thorough instruction to young men desiring to enter the Government
service. There has also been for a number of years an excellent
course of study in naval architecture at the University of Glasgow.
The Institute of Technology established in 1888 an elementary course
in ship construction, and this was followed in 1890 by a specialized
option in naval architecture extending through the four years. Already
forty-one men have graduated from this course.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">John D. Runkle, President, 1870&ndash;1878.</span></div></div>

<p>One of the large departments of the school is that of architecture.
Forming one of the original departments established at the beginning
of the Institute in 1865, when there was no similar department in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
country, it may fairly be affirmed to have led in the development of
instruction in this important profession. It was for many years in
charge of Prof. W.&nbsp;R. Ware, who left the Institute in 1880 to assume
charge of the newly established department at Columbia College. In
common with the other departments of the Institute, that of architecture
has developed enormously within recent years. Three times since
1883 has the department been obliged to change its location in order
to meet the continued need of expansion. From the original small
quarters in the upper floor of the Rogers Building, it has grown so
that it now occupies two and one half floors in the Pierce Building,
besides a large room for modelling in another building. The drawing-rooms
now accommodate over two hundred students. The department
has a magnificent library and a very large collection of
photographs and lantern slides. Under the careful management of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Prof. F.&nbsp;W. Chandler, who at the same time is head of the Architectural
Department of the city and member of the Fine Arts Commission, it
has now attained a most enviable reputation. Institute students competed
for several years for the prizes offered by the New York Société
des Beaux Arts, and in each competition in which they entered they
carried off the gold medal and the highest honors. In the three competitions
of ’94&ndash;’95, no less than seventy sets of drawings were submitted
by all competitors. The two gold medals, four first mentions and two
second mentions were awarded to Institute students. Of the nine
designs sent from the Institute, six were placed by the jury among the
first eight of the seventy designs submitted; two received second place
and one was put out of competition because of too great deviation from
the preliminary sketch. This great success is doubtless due to the
rigorous training which the students receive in architectural design
at the hands of Professor Despradelle, himself a graduate of the École
des Beaux Arts, a winner of high honors in Paris, and of the third
prize in the recent Phœbe Hearst world competition for the new buildings
of the University of California, and within a few weeks the winner
of the first medal in architecture in the Paris Salon of 1900. For three
years the students are continually engaged upon architectural design,
and the work of each student is examined and criticised before the
class by a jury from the Boston Society of Architects. Students in
architecture have also the opportunity, if they desire, of taking an
option in architectural engineering, in which they are given a course in
the theory and design of structures as rigid as that received by the
students in civil engineering. The relations between architecture and
engineering are exceedingly close and are becoming closer every year.
The work of the architect, aside from the æsthetic design of his buildings,
is becoming more and more like the work of the engineer, and
requires a thorough knowledge of engineering construction.</p>

<p>During the past year, after very careful consideration, the faculty
has also established an option in the course of architecture, devoted
particularly to landscape architecture, including, besides a large amount
of work in architecture proper, instruction in horticulture and landscape
design, on the one hand, and in surveying, topographical drawing,
drainage, etc., on the other hand. The landscape architect has heretofore
had no opportunity to secure a thorough training in his profession,
except by passing through an apprenticeship, as was formerly
necessary in the older professions. On account of the steady increase
in this country in the demand for trained landscape architects and the
increasing attention which is now being paid by our municipalities to
questions concerning public parks, and also by private individuals to
the beautifying of private grounds, there seems now to be an unusual
opportunity for young men to devote themselves to this branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the profession. As usual, the Institute of Technology is early in the
field with a course designed to this end.</p>

<div id="ip_276" class="figcenter" style="width: 542px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hydraulic Surveying in the Essex Canal, Lowell.</span></div></div>

<p>The last of the engineering departments to be considered and one
of the largest, is that of civil engineering, a department established
when the Institute was founded, and until 1881 under the direction of
that accomplished scholar and teacher, Prof. J.&nbsp;B. Henck, and since
1887 in charge of the writer. This department has grown since 1886
from four to eleven teachers, and from sixty to one hundred and fifty-three
students in the three upper classes. It now occupies the two
upper floors of the Engineering Building, or about twenty-three thousand
square feet. In recognition of the increasing importance of sanitary
questions affecting the health of communities, a new branch of
civil engineering was recognized by the Institute in 1889 by the establishment
of a regular four years’ course in sanitary engineering, in
which particular attention is directed to such problems, and students
are afforded opportunities of studying the bearing of chemistry and
biology upon them. Here again the breadth and specialization of the
work at the Institute was shown, rendering it possible with no change
in the teaching force and with no disarrangement of studies, to establish
such a course of instruction as soon as the need for it became apparent.</p>

<p>Interesting work has been done under the direction of Professor
Burton, professor of topographical engineering, in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
measurement of base lines with the steel tape. After devising an
apparatus for holding and supporting the tape, and measuring the
coefficient of expansion of actual tapes, an application was recently
made of the thermophone for determining the exact average temperature
of the tape. This instrument, which was invented a few
years ago by two Institute graduates, allows the average temperature
of the tape to be measured within half a degree.</p>

<p>An interesting department of the Institute, and one that has of
recent years assumed great practical importance, is that of biology.
It was organized in 1882, as an outgrowth of what was prior to that
date the course in natural history, and now has a teaching force of
six, under the direction of Prof. William T. Sedgwick, and occupies,
with its laboratories and lecture-rooms, one entire floor of the Pierce
Building. There are five distinct laboratories, fully equipped, with
private rooms, store and preparation rooms, and a library and reading-room,
and it is perhaps safe to say that nowhere in the United States
is there so compact or well arranged a series of laboratories devoted
chiefly to the sanitary, hygienic and industrial aspects of biology. The
great advances in sanitary science in recent years have made bacteriology
one of the most important, as well as one of the most practical, of the
biological sciences, and the biologist has taken his place beside the
chemist and the engineer in the study of the science and art of public
sanitation. But bacteriology is of importance, not only in sanitary
science, but also in its industrial relations. Great industries, like those
connected with food preserving, canning, vinegar making, tanning and
brewing, depend upon the activity or the exclusion of micro-organisms.
As might be expected in a school of applied science, the development
of the biological department in the Institute has been mainly along
sanitary and industrial lines, rather than in the direction of zoölogy.
The biological work in connection with the recent important investigations
of the State Board of Health regarding the purification of
water and the disposal of sewage, was done at the Institute, and early
led to special instruction in these directions. In 1894 a course was
established in the micro-organisms of fermentation, not only new to
the Institute, but, it is believed, to the United States. Important
researches had been made in Denmark in these lines, and in order to
become thoroughly familiar with them, one of the instructors of the
department spent a summer in the laboratory of Alfred Jörgensen, in
Copenhagen. In 1896, a more elaborate course, that in industrial
biology, was established, and since that time special studies have been
made in various lines, such as the efficiency of sterilizing processes, the
preparation of canned goods and the cultivation of butter bacteria.
This department is destined to still greater development in the near
future, and its laboratories are finely equipped in every direction.</p>

<p>Reference to the different departments in the Institute would not
be complete without brief mention of its department of general studies.
It is perhaps seldom recognized, but it is nevertheless a fact that the
Institute, although primarily a technical school, is better equipped for
giving instruction in languages, in history, in economics and statistics
and in political science than many classical institutions. Indeed, the
only important department of study which is found in such institutions,
and for which no provision is made at the Institute, is that of ancient
languages. The force of instruction in the department of general
studies, leaving out of consideration the department of modern languages,
comprises two professors, one associate professor, three assistant
professors, one instructor and one assistant, a total of eight, probably
a larger number than is found in any but the very largest colleges.
In the department of modern languages, there is one professor, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
associate professor, one assistant professor and four instructors. There
are offered ten distinct courses in English, eleven in modern languages,
eight in history and twenty in economics and statistics and in political
science. As already stated, it has been a fundamental principle in the
government of the school that all regular students should receive a not
inconsiderable amount of instruction in these subjects, but in addition
to the engineering and other technical courses, there is a so-called
course in general studies, designed to train young men for business
occupations, in which, besides thorough courses in chemistry, physics
and other sciences, a large amount of time is devoted to the general
studies which have been referred to. The late president of the Institute,
General Walker, whose principal work, aside from that relating to
education, lay in the field of economics and statistics, took great interest
in the development of this general course, and to him, more than to
anybody else, is due its present high standard. Seventy-eight young
men have graduated from the department, and in many respects its
course of study offers advantages over the usual college course.</p>

<p>Summer schools are maintained by the Institute in the departments
of civil engineering, mining engineering and architecture. That in
civil engineering affords continuous field practice in geodesy and
hydraulics during about a month. That in mining engineering affords
students an opportunity to visit mining or metallurgical works and to
become practically acquainted with the methods employed by actually
taking part in them. These summer schools in mining and metallurgy
have been held in all parts of the country, from Nova Scotia to Lake
Superior and Colorado. The summer school in architecture consists not
infrequently of a trip abroad, with detailed studies and sketches of
special types of architecture.</p>

<p>The Institute also offers extended courses of free evening lectures,
of which twenty courses of twelve lectures each were given during the
past year. These courses, established by the trustee of the Lowell
Institute under the supervision of the Institute, correspond to one
portion of President Rogers’s original plan, and are fully appreciated
by young men who cannot afford the time for a complete and consecutive
education. The trustee of the Lowell Institute also established
in 1872, and has maintained ever since, a special school of practical
design, under the supervision of the Institute, in which young men and
women are given free instruction in the art of making patterns for
prints, ginghams, silks, laces, paper hangings, carpets, etc.; the object
being to fit them to engage in the textile industries especially, but also
in other branches of manufacture in which taste in form and color is
an essential element for success.</p>

<p>Mention may be made here of the fact that all work at the Institute
is open to women on the same terms as to men. As early as 1867,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
among the Lowell free courses, there were two chemical courses open
to both sexes, and soon afterward women were admitted to the regular
work of the school. The first woman to graduate was Mrs. Ellen H.
Richards, in 1873, and since that time forty-eight women have received
the degree. This number, however, is no measure of the part which
women have taken in the work of the school, for a large majority of
those who attend are special students. During the year 1899&ndash;1900,
there were fifty-three women studying at the school, principally in
the departments of chemistry, biology, geology, physics and architecture.
From the last-named course eleven young women have graduated,
one of whom was the designer of the Woman’s Building at the Chicago
Exposition.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Institute which has not been mentioned is
the sub-division of its libraries. Instead of having one general library,
each department has its special library, conveniently located with
reference to its rooms. This involves a slight duplication of books,
but is of the greatest advantage to students and teachers for consultation.
The Institute libraries are not large, compared with the libraries
of many colleges and universities, but they are remarkably rich along
the lines of the special topics to which they are of necessity principally
devoted, and particularly in scientific periodicals. The total number
of periodicals in all languages regularly received at the Institute,
not including a large number of official reports, is eight hundred and
forty-seven. In the engineering library alone there are one hundred
and seventy-three. It is believed that this forms one of the largest
collections of scientific journals to be found anywhere. The Institute
publishes a scientific magazine, known as the Technology Quarterly,
which was established in 1887, and is the official organ for the publication
of the results of tests in the laboratories and of special investigations
by members of the staff and by students and alumni. The
Association of Class Secretaries also publishes the Technology Review,
a more popular quarterly, established only two years ago, and devoted to
the social and general interests of the Institute. In 1896 the Technology
Club was started, occupying a building near the Institute and
affording alumni and students the social advantages of a clubhouse.
The alumni of the Institute now number two thousand three hundred
and thirty-nine; they maintain an Alumni Association which holds annual
meetings, and seven local branch associations which are scattered
over the country from the Connecticut Valley to Colorado.</p>

<p>In reviewing the success which this school has attained, the question
naturally presents itself: To what is this success due? Let me here
record my conviction that it has been due mainly to the courage and
devotion of its corporation and of the presidents who have directed its
policy. In this respect no institution was ever more fortunate. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
a guiding body possessed of the courage and faith that have animated
the corporation of the institution from the earliest days, and especially
with the able men who have been its presidents, success was assured.
While the school was yet struggling for its very existence, with few
friends and little money, they never faltered. They have not hesitated
again and again to plunge the school deeply into debt when
its needs required it, trusting to the generosity of New England
that it should not be allowed to be crippled, and each time has their
confidence been justified. Poverty has never been permitted to impair
the efficiency of the school. As President Crafts remarked in a recent
annual report, “We are less favored than many neighboring institutions
in building space, but we have always followed the wise policy of
keeping in the foremost rank and in some departments leading the
way in supplying the best methods and apparatus for teaching and for
making investigation. We have run in debt to buy them, and run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
still further in debt to build houses to hold them, but we have always
had them when the head of a department told the government of the
school that they were necessary to the most efficient teaching of his
science.” With a corporation acting on such a principle there could
be no failure. It is true that the faculty have stood unfalteringly, even
in the darkest days, for high scholarship; and equally true that the
school has been remarkably fortunate in the character of the young
men who have sought its halls, but no faculty and no body of students
could have brought success with a corporation less broadminded and
courageous. Let me here add my tribute to the work which was done
by the late General Francis A. Walker, president of the institute from
1881 till 1897. Probably no single person did more to secure the
success of the school than he. His great administrative ability, his
wide acquaintance, his accurate judgment of men, his magnificent
courage and his splendid enthusiasm, were factors in the development
of the school whose importance it is difficult to overestimate.</p>

<p>General Walker was succeeded by President James M. Crafts, who
had been connected with the Institute for many years as professor of
chemistry, and under whose energetic administration the progress of
the Institute has been steadily continued. In fact, thanks to some
unexpected additions to the funds of the school, its material resources
and its equipment have been more enlarged and extended during the
past three years than in many years previous. Only a few months ago,
however, President Crafts, desiring to devote himself more uninterruptedly
to the pursuit of the science which first awakened his enthusiasm
and in which he has attained such eminent distinction, both in
this country and abroad, decided to relinquish his office. The corporation
has chosen as his successor, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, for many
years professor of astronomy in Washington University, St. Louis, and
for the past few years superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey
at Washington. A more fortunate selection could not have been made,
and the well-known scientific and administrative ability of Dr. Pritchett
will no doubt be the means not only of maintaining the present high
reputation of the school, but of extending and enlarging it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Institute is still unendowed in the sense that its
receipts from invested property constitute but a very small part of the
means required to carry on the school. To quote from one of President
Walker’s reports, “No other institution of our size but has two, three
or four times the amount of wealth to draw upon which we possess.
It has only been exceeding good fortune, combined with extreme courage,
energy and self-devotion on the part of its trustees and teachers
that has more than once rescued the school from paralysis, if not from
extinction.” In 1898&ndash;’99, the total expenditures of the school were
about $367,500, while the current receipts were about $347,500, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
a deficit of about $20,000. Of the current receipts, $207,000, or 59 per
cent, were from students’ fees. Dividing the total expenditures by the
number of students, we find an expenditure of $314 per student, without
counting interest on the value of land and buildings, while the tuition
fee is $200. The invested funds of the Institute amount to but
$1,917,000. All gifts and legacies, with the exception of this amount,
have had to go into land, buildings and equipment. Between 1888 and
1899 the Institute has been obliged to spend $350,000 for land, the
purchase of which has been a great burden, and within a few years a
further expenditure of $260,000 in this direction has been made.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Henry S. Pritchett, President-Elect of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</span></div></div>

<p>The bearing of these figures will perhaps be realized by comparing
them with similar figures regarding Cornell University, which is largely
a technical school, since nearly one half of its students pursue technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
courses similar to those in the Institute. In 1898 the total income of
that university was $583,000, of which about $121,000, or only 20 per
cent, was received from tuition fees. Its invested funds amounted to
$6,446,818.</p>

<p>The State has generously given aid to the Institute in some of its
most trying times; as in 1888, when it gave $200,000, one half unconditionally
and the other half for the support of free scholarships;
and again in 1895, when it granted unconditionally $25,000 a year for
six years and $2,000 a year additional for scholarships. Although the
school has a very inadequate endowment, yet the future looks bright.
It is significant of the general appreciation of its work that men and
women who have not received a technical education have devoted a
large part of their fortunes to providing such education for others.
Among the recent benefactors of the Institute we may name Henry L.
Pierce, John W. Randall, Mrs. Julia B. Huntington James and Edward
Austin, who, within less than three years have bequeathed nearly a
million and a half dollars to the school. If the large gifts of recent
years are continued, the school will before long be put financially
upon a level with its neighbors. May we not hope that as the applications
of science to the arts enrich the alumni and friends of the Institute,
they may help to make the road easy for their successors by devoting
a part of their riches to the advancement of technical education?</p>

<h2 title="The Psychology of Crazes" id="psychology">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CRAZES.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor G. T. W. PATRICK</span>,<br />

<span class="small">UNIVERSITY OF IOWA.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A well-known</span> Washington newspaper correspondent, writing
of the recent Congress of the Daughters of the American
Revolution and its disorderly meetings, says: “It is the unanimous
opinion of those who have attended the congress that, while the
Daughters of the American Revolution, individually, are nearly all
intellectual, refined and attractive women, collectively they are an
uncontrollable mob.” Why is the social conduct of human beings
different from their conduct as individuals? This is the problem of the
new science of social psychology. The following study of crazes and
epidemics is offered as a slight contribution to this science.</p>

<p>By way of preface it might be said that a good deal of the confusion
as to the subject matter of social psychology would be avoided if it
were understood that this science is not the study of any mysterious
entity called ‘the social mind,’ nor the mere study of those individual
traits that make men social beings, such as imitation and suggestibility;
but rather the study of the peculiar and characteristic behavior of the
mind of the individual when under the influence of the social afflatus.
Under this influence we do indeed find that he becomes a different
being, and that his mental processes must be formulated by different
laws; and we are convinced that, as thus understood, social psychology
is just as distinct and legitimate a branch of study as is the psychology
of the child or the psychology of sex.</p>

<p>Now, in what ways is the behavior of man as a social being different
from his behavior as an individual? To answer this question in part, let
us examine his behavior in mental epidemics and crazes. I select these
because they illustrate in somewhat extreme form the influence of the
social afflatus.</p>

<p>If, for the sake of comparison, we first consider the normal individual
as such, we find that he is a perceiving, remembering, associating,
judging, reflecting, reasoning being; that he is subject to certain
feelings, emotions, desires and impulses, prompting him to action; that
his action is more or less deliberative, and, when it finally occurs, is
the result of a set of motives determined by the man’s character, which
in turn is the outcome of his heredity and education and his general
ability to appreciate and reflect the moral ideals of the social order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
which he belongs. If now we study this man in respect to his mental
development, whether from the savage or the child, we find that the
direction of change has been away from imitative, impulsive action,
towards thought, reflection, deliberation. He continually makes more
use of memory and, anticipating the future, regulates his action in the
light of his past experience. This change from the imitative and
impulsive to the reasoning man accompanies the development of
the higher brain centers, particularly of the cerebral cortex, upon
which depend the all-important functions of memory and association.
As an experiment it is quite possible to reduce this highly developed
reasoning being in a single moment to a condition resembling his primitive
state by means of hypnotism. In hypnosis there is a temporary
paralysis or sleep of the higher brain centers, upon which depends
deliberative, rational action, and, the lower (older) centers alone being
active, the subject becomes a mere ideo-motor machine acting out
every suggestion. In various related states of automatism, where there
is any spontaneity at all, the mentality and morality of the subject are
of a lower type and may be called reversionary in character, owing, no
doubt, to the fact that those brain centers which represent the most
recent acquirements of the race are temporarily out of the circuit.</p>

<p>If again we study the mind of the child, we find that it presents
many points of likeness to the mind of the hypnotic subject and to the
mind of the primitive man. We learn from biology that the child
is to some extent a recapitulation of the life of the race, passing
through in his individual development the stages of race development.
Physiologically speaking, the higher brain centers and the centers for
association, which are late acquirements of the race, are last developed
in the child. We are therefore not surprised to find that the child,
like the savage and the hypnotic subject, is imitative, impulsive, non-reflective,
incapable of much abstract thought, deliberation or reasoning,
and that he acts with a view to immediate rather than remote ends.</p>

<p>If now we turn to the behavior of the normal adult man in mental
epidemics and crazes of all kinds, from the Crusades to the Massacre
of St. Bartholomew, from the tulip mania in Holland to the Dewey
welcome in New York City, we observe that his behavior is to some
extent similar to that of the hypnotic subject, and the child, and the
primitive man. The general character of mental action in epidemics is
as follows: Men become imitative beings and their actions are determined
by suggestion from the actions of others. Memory and the
association of ideas are inactive, and there is an inability to reason and
an indisposition towards deliberation and calm reflection. Past experiences
are disregarded, remote consequences are not seen and behavior
is impulsive and spasmodic. Feeling is very strong and every kind of
emotion is apt to be exaggerated. Calm observation is also lacking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
mental images may be mistaken for objective reality, as in the case of
the hallucinations that are frequent in these phenomena.</p>

<p>The moral peculiarities of an epidemic are of a similar kind. Under
the influence of a craze, the moral character of a people suffers a
reversion to a primitive type. In times of epidemic waves the moral
standards of the crowd approach those of the savage. We observe the
exhibition of primitive instincts, such as cruelty, revenge and blood-thirstiness,
together with changeableness, fanaticism, self-sacrifice and
enthusiastic devotion to a leader. All these moral traits were well
illustrated in the Revolution crazes in France and in the persecution
of witches in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Even in our
own times a striking example of the primitive character of the morality
of a people under the influence of social excitement was seen in the
battle-cry of our American sailors in the recent Spanish war, ‘Remember
the Maine,’ the ethical motive being a precipitate impulse to seek revenge.
An instance like this can not be explained upon the theory that
it represented the actual individual morality of the sailors participating
in the battles, for it was echoed and apparently endorsed by the press
throughout the country and upon the platform and even in the pulpit.
It is hardly conceivable that an Englishman of noble birth should
openly boast of his joy in being revenged upon an enemy; yet collective
England is wild with delight when ‘Majuba Hill is avenged!’</p>

<p>We are thus led apparently to the theory that, for some reason not
yet evident, under the influence of social excitement, something takes
place in the brain of the individual not unlike the action of hypnotism,
by which the higher centers representing the more recent moral and
mental acquirements of the race are temporarily paralyzed, reducing
the subject in a greater or less degree to the condition of the child and
of the primitive man. The observation of certain physical phenomena
which often accompany mental epidemics tends to confirm this theory
and at the same time to suggest a possible explanation. Epidemics of
the more extreme kind are apt to be accompanied by great muscular
excitability, varying all the way from mere extreme mobility, such as
shouting, jumping and throwing the arms, to convulsions like those
of epilepsy. The dancing manias of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
furnish the best illustrations of this, although these phenomena
did not equal in intensity the frightful physical convulsions during
the religious revivals in Kentucky at the beginning of this century.
The particular character of these muscular movements is determined
by imitation and suggestion. The movements themselves are no doubt
due to congestion and irritation of the motor centers, or at least to a
rapid overflow of nervous discharges at these centers, an accompaniment
of the excessive emotion which attends all mental epidemics. In
such a condition of the nervous system, thought, reasoning, memory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
association can have little place, or, to express it physiologically, the
unusual excitement in the lower centers of the brain accompanying
excessive emotion may not only find expression in muscular movements,
but may also exercise an inhibitory or paralyzing effect upon the higher
centers, resulting in a kind of hypnotic condition. Neither is it difficult
to understand the presence of this excessive emotion during mental
epidemics or during any purely social movements, when we remember
that war itself is the great original social movement, which even in
this age always takes the form of a mental epidemic called the war
spirit. The emotional effect of the mere physical congregation of a
large number of men, the emotion increasing with the size of the assemblage,
is known to all.</p>

<p>As we glance now at a few of the typical mental epidemics of history,
we shall notice the ever-recurring presence of some or all of the mental
and moral traits that I have pointed out. For illustrations of these
phenomena we may turn indifferently to ancient, medieval or modern
history. They abound at every period.</p>

<p>Very good examples may be found in Hecker’s ‘Epidemics of the
Middle Ages.’ In the Crusades, particularly in the Children’s Crusades,
we may observe all the mental, moral and physical peculiarities
that have been mentioned. In the anti-Semitic mania, we see in its
history of criminal horror the dehumanizing effects of the epidemic
and the moral reversion which takes place under the influence of
social excitement. The peculiar physical phenomena which have been
referred to as characterizing epidemic excitement are best illustrated
in the dancing manias of the Middle Ages and in the religious revival.
Although epidemic ‘revivals’ have occurred in all countries, some of
the best illustrations are seen in America in its early history and to
some extent at the present day. At the time of the elder Edwards,
revivals were accompanied by fainting, falling, tremor and numbness.
In the Kentucky revivals the meetings, called camp meetings, were held
in the open air. The interest in them spread in true epidemic form.
At the height of the excitement, as many as 20,000 people, men, women
and children, were gathered in a single camp at one time. Dr. Davidson,
who writes a history of this revival, says that “the laborer quitted
his task, age snatched his crutch, youth forgot his pastime, the plough
was left in the furrow, business of all kinds was suspended, bold hunters
and sober matrons, young men, maidens and little children flocked to
the common center of attraction.” The emotional tension was very
great. A boy perhaps would spring to his feet and begin to rave, or
some over-excited person would utter a piercing shriek, or a cry of
triumph, and this would be the signal for a general hysterical outbreak,
accompanied by many remarkable physical symptoms. Of these the
most common were falling in convulsive spasms, jerking, dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
barking like dogs, fainting, crying, singing, praying and cursing.
Sometimes whole companies were seized with uncontrollable laughing
fits, called the holy laugh. At a meeting in East Tennessee, six hundred
began jerking at one time. In many instances sensibility
would be lost and the extremities would be cold, while the face was
flushed. In some places the sufferers were laid out in rows and squares
in the churchyard until they should recover. From a medical point of
view we should call this epidemic chorea, but its more exact physiology
I have already referred to. When closely examined, the phenomena
lose a part at least of their mysterious character. We must
remember that religious emotions are powerful, deep and ancient. The
effect, furthermore, is increased by the general epidemic excitement,
by the element of large and unwonted gatherings of people, by imitation,
by the stimulating music and by the fearfully exciting power of
human shrieks and wild cries and prayers. Such a nervous condition
induced in an individual must have two results: first, the escape of the
unusual nervous excitement in motor channels, giving rise to the
choreic movements; and second, the paralysis of the higher brain centers,
resulting in various hypnotic phenomena and reversionary morality
and mentality.</p>

<p>Many of these scenes were repeated in the great revival that swept
New York and the Middle States, beginning in the year 1832. In
these meetings preachers who kept cool and reasoned logically were not
listened to. There was rather a demand for the wild, impetuous,
vociferous, physically impassioned oratory of the rude man. As an
example of reversionary morals in this epidemic, we may notice the
fact mentioned by Albert Rhodes that in response to visions many men
put away their own wives and took others from their neighbors.</p>

<p>From the psychological point of view perhaps the most instructive
of all epidemics is the demonophobia or witchcraft mania which raged
from the end of the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth centuries.
The savage’s fear of demons and of unseen supernatural agencies lurking
in every forest and moor now took hold of the modern world and turned
the people, not into brutes and devils as we figuratively say, but simply
into the original savages from which they came, whose basal instincts
they still carried in their lower nervous centers, to be brought out under
the influence of a social craze. The ecclesiastical authorities, both
Roman and Protestant, led in this homicidal frenzy, while sedate
judges, learned jurors and wise legislators lent their zealous aid. It
spread in true epidemic form all over the Continent and into England
and Scotland, even to America. Distinguished jurists declared that
ordinary methods of trial should not be used for this offence, for so
difficult is it to bring proof of the crime of witchcraft, that out of
a million of witches not one could be convicted if the usual course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
justice were followed. One contemporary of undoubted authority wrote
that he saw a list of three thousand witches that had been put to death
during the time of the Long Parliament alone. In this reign of
demonophobia the psychological phenomena of the craze are well illustrated.
The exciting cause was a widespread contagious and epidemic
fear. The result was a recrudescence of the barbaric instincts of
cruelty, torture and homicide, accompanied by a loss not merely of
reasoning power, but apparently of common sense, so that intelligent
men seemed to believe that old women blasted the crops in the fields and
the offspring of animals, and raised storms and whirlwinds. The
cruelty characteristic of the savage is again noticed in this case. In
the witchcraft persecutions, the victims were commonly weak women,
particularly the more helpless old and young, while the character of
the inflictions was such as is peculiar to primitive people, viz., torture
and burning alive. The perfidy of the savage is also noticed, as in
innumerable instances the victims were led to believe that they would be
spared if they made a confession, and were then put to death. To
elude a legal requirement that torture should not be repeated, the most
horrible tortures were ‘continued’ from day to day.</p>

<p>The psychology of crazes is clearly seen in certain of its aspects in
the homicidal manias that have swept over communities or whole
countries at frequent intervals in the world’s history. The homicidal
impulse itself is one of the most primitive and basal of all impulses.
The reason for this is apparent. The history of man has been a history
of warfare and of struggle for existence. It has been man against man,
tribe against tribe, nation against nation. Habits like these are not
quickly unlearned, and reversion to them in times of social disturbance
is not strange. In the massacre of St. Bartholomew we have a
typical instance of the homicidal mania. The necessary conditions
were, first, great emotional excitement caused by religious fanaticism
acting as an inhibitory agent upon the higher brain centers and allowing
the primitive impulses to act unchecked; second, the removal of
external and customary restraints, effected in this case by the royal
decree; and third, the mental effects of imitation and suggestion.
These conditions being all supplied, the French people resolved themselves
speedily into assassins and cut-throats, and enjoyed a homicidal
debauch. Begun in Paris, the massacre spread in true epidemic form
throughout France, until fifteen or twenty thousand people had
perished.</p>

<p>These homicidal manias have, of course, been very frequent in
history. The decivilizing influence of the craze is, however, most perfectly
illustrated in the various scenes of the French Revolution. Here
the overturning of the social and religious order itself acted in part as
the unsettling and emotionally exciting cause. The usual results followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
The effect of social excitement in paralyzing the intellect was
shown in this case in the wholesale and useless destruction of women
and children. Furthermore, this reversion to the manners of the savage
carries with it its appropriate mood. The slaughterers are not like
demons, as we imagine demons to be, but rather like thoughtless children.
There is merriment and much gayety, and there is dancing and
singing around the corpses, and seats are arranged for the ladies, who
are eager to enjoy the spectacle; and finally the victims are made to
pass through a double row of executioners, who carve them into pieces
gradually, so that all can saturate themselves with the sight of the
bloodshed.</p>

<p>Although in some cases wars may be coolly planned by the people’s
leaders for personal or political reasons or for purposes of national
conquest, still they all depend for their successful issue upon the
homicidal impulse in the masses of people. This is called the war spirit
and is always of an epidemic character. It may have any degree of
ferocity or mildness. It has a tendency to be periodic, so that if it has
slumbered for a considerable period a very slight cause is sufficient to
awaken it. A mere boundary line in Venezuela, in which this country
had but a remote interest, was sufficient a few years ago to excite this
war spirit in a milder form, when a curious craze for a war with Great
Britain flowed like a wave across this country.</p>

<p>Any war will furnish instructive material to the student of social
psychology. In the late Spanish-American war, for instance, we all
felt the war spirit which flowed in epidemic form across the country
and engulfed it. The first motive of the war, the altruistic desire to
free an oppressed people, was of the ideal glittering kind, well fitted to
excite the emotions of the masses. A dramatic event further fans this
emotional flame, and at once the aggregate personality of the nation
is in a condition of automatism, where primitive instincts, such as
revenge and lust for the paraphernalia of war, are no longer checked
by the more lately acquired moral principles. Congressmen, editors,
members of peace societies, ministers of the gospel, forget their long
and patient efforts to establish means for settling national differences by
arbitration and join lustily in the war cry, and the psychologically
curious spectacle is presented of a great nation, priding itself as a leader
in the world’s morals, giving to the appeal of a weaker nation for the
arbitration of a dispute the answer of shot and shell. Although the
motive of blood for blood is a moral motive belonging to a bygone age
and in individual ethics has long been outgrown, yet collectively, under
the influence of the war craze, we revert to it, and it is shamelessly
proclaimed from platform and editorial room and vigorously applauded
by the people. We have seen that cruelty and the persecution of the
weak by the strong were among the reversionary symptoms of the social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
epidemic in many instances. We may notice curiously enough a trace
of these qualities here, where the fact that our enemy was a greatly
inferior power does not detract in our eyes from the brilliancy of our
victories, though in the ethics of the individual such a circumstance
would put us to shame. In all this we proceed strictly in accordance
with international law, but international law itself is only international
custom and is the mere expression of the wonted behavior of the aggregate
personality, particularly in times of war. As such it does not
represent the highest ethical development of man, but that lower stage
of development to which he reverts in times of social excitement. From
this point of view it is possible to understand why international ethics
is so far behind individual ethics. Personal disputes were once settled
by brute force as international disputes are now settled. There is no
reason to doubt that the latter will, somewhat later in the history of
civilization, be settled by courts of arbitration and enforced by a
system of police as the former now are.</p>

<p>The considerations now before us show the futility of peace congresses
in that part of their work which contemplates the enforced
substitution of arbitration for war. Peace congresses are not social
movements. They spring from the efforts of individual men, leaders
in social reform. They belong to the upward ethical movements led
by individuals, the slow, painful climbing towards higher moral and
intellectual standards. These congresses may meet and discuss arbitration
and perfect an international program, but they labor in vain, for
they forget that social man has a double personality and that the personality
that meets and deliberates in the peace congress is not the
personality that, under the influence of the war craze, thrills with
emotion and acts from ancient and deep rooted impulses and motives.
When the war spirit sweeps over a country the social personality passes
into a condition not unlike that of hypnosis and is ruled by a different
set of moral principles. It should not be understood from this that
peace congresses are useless. They are a part of an educative system
whose influence in the end will be strong enough to react upon the
secondary social personality and determine its behavior.</p>

<p>Among crazes of a different kind, we may notice financial crazes
as an interesting type, falling under the same laws as those mentioned.
Both in panics and in speculative manias we observe again a species of
hypnotization. In the case of the latter the ordinary business shrewdness
which characterizes the dealings of the individual in a normal state
and which depends upon the activity of late developed association tracts
in the brain, is to a large extent lost. The memory is impaired and
what in general we may call prudence is lacking.</p>

<p>The psychology of the speculative mania is very simple. There is
first, greed, furnishing the necessary emotional excitement; then imitation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
then precipitate, unreasoning action. In the panic, the psychological
sequence is the same, except that fear takes the place of greed.
The stampede among animals may be taken as the type of all panics.
It is a reflex phenomenon consisting merely of contagious fear and
precipitate, unintelligent flight. Fear and flight constitute a most primitive
form of mental action, equalled in primitive character only by
that other form whose survival we have seen illustrated in wars and
homicidal manias, viz., anger and combat. Although the individual
has long outgrown these simple reflexes, yet in social excitement he
reverts to them. The recrudescence of the first of these two forms
is seen in the case of panics in theatres and burning buildings, where
social fear is followed by unintelligent flight, there being a temporary
paralysis of reason, prudence, the power of choosing means to ends,
respect for women and consideration for the weak and feeble.</p>

<p>The limits of this paper permit me only to refer to other forms
of the craze illustrating the same laws. In fads and fashions of all
kinds, the behavior of the social personality is different only in degree
from that already described in the more serious epidemics. The law
of imitation is the same, but there is less excitement and emotional
disturbance and consequently a lesser paralysis of the higher mental
faculties and a lesser return to barbaric impulses. Whereas the others
may be called forms of social paranoia, these may be called forms of
social monomania. A single idea fills the public mind, and as a result
this idea is unduly exalted as to its importance and worth. The higher
mental powers are paralyzed only so far as that there is a perverted
judgment as to the relative importance of things and consequently a
more or less distorted view of the world and its values. Perhaps the
simplest form of this craze is seen in the epidemic character of children’s
games. At different times of the season different games completely
fill the social consciousness of the child-world, so that for the moment
there is no interest in any other game. New and interesting sports,
such, for instance, as golf, often fill the social adult consciousness in
the same way. Then there are social and literary fads, crazes in musical
airs, fashions in dress, furniture, houses and carriages, without number.
Crazes of all kinds have found a prolific soil in America. The
American mind is highly suggestible. One fad after another rages over
the country and in some cases reduces the aggregate mind to a condition
of idiocy. The Dewey craze in New York City last year is an illustration
of this. Nothing but a sort of hypnotic distortion of intellectual
vision could cause grown men to stand in line for an hour in order that
they might sit for an instant in the chair in which the hero sat during
the review, or to fight for shreds of the flags and awnings that decorated
the platform.</p>

<p>Sporadic social reform movements take the form of crazes and illustrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the same laws. One recalls the Woman’s Crusade in 1873, the
result not of a rational plan but of imitation, and the Granger movement
and the Farmers’ Alliance and the greenback craze and the silver
craze and many others.</p>

<p>Since Aristotle we have been told that man is a social animal and
that to study him as he really is we must not isolate him from society.
The evident truth of this may lead us to forget that it is but a half
truth and the uncritical acceptance of it will lead us wholly astray in our
sociological study. The inference which we seem compelled to draw
from studies in social psychology is that social man is, in his ethical
and intellectual development, many stages behind the individual man.
The progress of civilization is a slow, painful, upward climbing, in
which individuals are the thinkers, the planners, the promoters and the
leaders. The mind of society, on the other hand, using the phrase
in the sense defined, is an imitative, unreflective, half-hypnotic, half-barbaric
mind, always acting as a drag upon the upward and forward
movement, and, in times of crazes, epidemics and social cataclysms,
gaining temporary dominance and causing disastrous relapses to a lower
plane of civilization.</p>

<h2 title="Some Phases of the Earth’s Development in the Light of Recent Chemical Research" id="some">SOME PHASES OF THE EARTH’S DEVELOPMENT IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT CHEMICAL RESEARCH.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor</span> EDWARD RENOUF.<br />

<span class="small">JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the following pages an effort is made to apply some of the results
of recent chemical research to the earlier history of the earth.
It is hoped that the main facts brought out may be readily grasped by
those who have never studied chemistry, and that each link in the
chain of events will be made evident to those who have mastered the
rudiments of this science.</p>

<p>Chemical action involves change of composition. Substances more
or less complex may be broken down into simpler substances, or from
several simpler substances a complex substance may be built up. From
the complex ore of copper found in nature the simple element copper
is obtained. From the elements sulphur and oxygen and the simple
substance water the complex sulphuric acid is built up. Within the last
few years the high temperature of the electric arc&mdash;the heat generated
by a powerful electric current playing between two carbon poles&mdash;has
been employed in bringing about chemical changes which do not
occur at ordinary temperatures nor at those obtainable by burning fuel.
The electric furnace is used industrially to make calcium carbide from
lime and coke, carbon silicide (carborundum) from coke and sand, and
the metal aluminum from its compounds.</p>

<p>Chemical changes at high temperatures have long been an object of
research, but it was not until the introduction of the electric furnace
that it was possible to command temperatures high enough to make
exhaustive studies. In the last few years several chemists, especially
Moissan, of Paris, and his pupils, have done systematic work with the
aid of the arc furnace. The furnace used in the laboratory for high
temperature work is a small and simple apparatus; Moissan’s furnace is
a block of quick lime a little longer and wider than a page of this
magazine and about three inches thick. A rectangular cavity is cut
on the upper surface of this block. A similar block forms the cover.
In opposite grooves between the top and bottom piece are placed the
carbons, such as are used in ordinary arc lights. The arc plays across
the cavity in such a manner that the substance to be heated is not
brought into the arc itself, which is vaporized carbon, but below it.
The cavity thus represents a tiny reverberatory furnace; the arc heats
the roof and sides to an intense heat, which is radiated on the open dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
or closed crucible or tube containing the substance heated. This is the
simplest form of laboratory furnace. Various modifications are used,
but in all the size is small and the arrangement simple. A powerful arc
plays in the smallest possible cavity with the object of attaining the
maximum of temperature, expense and duration of material being secondary
considerations. Lime and magnesia are the best materials, because
they are at the same time the most refractory substances available
and are poor conductors of heat. A furnace top one and one half inches
thick may be heated by so powerful an arc that the melted quick lime
drips from the inner surface, while the outer surface is scarcely warm to
the touch of the hand. Moissan has utilized in these little furnaces currents
of electricity of varied strength, the lowest being that given by a
four horse-power dynamo, the highest that generated by three hundred
horse power. The highest temperatures obtained were about 3,500°
centigrade (6,300° Fahrenheit), with the heat constantly increasing;
the limit to the obtainable temperature&mdash;as far as the experimental evidence
showed&mdash;was merely the lack of any known substance refractory
enough to bear the heat; for at the temperature mentioned quick lime
and magnesia not only melt but are changed into gases, so that the furnace
was filled with the vapors of its own material.</p>

<p>The effect of the heat on single substances is very interesting.
Refractory metals, such as iron, manganese, uranium, platinum, melt
rapidly and then become gaseous; the most refractory non-metallic
elements, silicon, boron, carbon, are also changed into the gaseous
form. Very refractory compounds are broken down into simpler ones.
Magnesium pyrophosphate yields phosphorus, magnesium oxide and
oxygen. Asbestos&mdash;a magnesium silicate&mdash;gives as chief product magnesium
silicide; the other substances formed being silicon, silicon
dioxide and a little magnesium oxide.</p>

<p>Such are the astounding changes wrought by simple heat upon
those substances which we are accustomed to regard as infusible. It
must be remembered that the range of temperature which chemists
employ in ordinary laboratory work is not very great and that the
conditions of work in the laboratory and of nature’s work on the
earth’s surface at the present day favor the formation of two
classes of compounds&mdash;the oxides and their hydrates. Although
air is a mixture consisting mainly of four parts of nitrogen and
one of oxygen, atmospheric nitrogen is generally inert at ordinary
temperatures, and it is the oxygen of the air which is the more important
factor in the growth of living things and in changes in lifeless
matter. Water, a compound of oxygen and hydrogen, is present everywhere,
either in the liquid form or as vapor in the air; even in the flame
of the hottest fires there is water vapor in abundance, since water is
one of the chief products of combustion of most forms of fuel. Is it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
wonder that under such conditions we find the earth’s crust to contain
the elements chiefly compounded with oxygen? Was this always so?
Are we justified in supposing that conditions may have prevailed&mdash;nay,
must have prevailed&mdash;in former times on the earth’s surface, which
gave to other elements as important or more important functions than
to oxygen? The answer to these questions must be sought in the results
of the chemistry of high temperatures.</p>

<p>First let us consider the conditions of existence of the omnipresent
water. Water begins to break down into its components, hydrogen
and oxygen, at 934° centigrade; at 2,500° centigrade (4,500° Fahrenheit)
the decomposition is complete. In other words, water vapor
cannot exist at temperatures above 2,500°, but the hydrogen and oxygen
exist in the free state.</p>

<p>Astronomers tell us that refractory elements like iron, silicon and
carbon, perhaps disassociated into still simpler substances, are present
as vapor in the atmosphere of the sun and that many others of our
well-known elements, including hydrogen, are also present in this
glowing atmosphere, while the heat of the sun’s surface and that of the
hotter stars is vastly higher than that of the electric furnace. Geologists
believe that the evidence at their disposal points to a similar
period of great heat in the early history of the earth. It may be considered,
then, that temperatures higher than those of the electric furnace
prevailed in former times on the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the study of the results obtained with the
electric furnace. The following reactions are especially important. If
metals, or refractory non-metals, or metallic or non-metallic oxides, or
complex silicates, are heated to the higher temperatures in contact with
carbon, boron, silicon or compounds of these three elements with
oxygen, the result generally is that very refractory carbides, borides or
silicides of the metals or non-metals are formed. In other words, those
complex substances which form the chief constituents of the outer crust
of the earth at the present day are decomposed at high temperatures,
and simple compounds of two elements&mdash;so-called binary compounds&mdash;are
formed. Four classes of these binary substances seem to be especially
stable at high heat&mdash;the carbides, borides, silicides and oxides;
but the oxygen of the metallic oxides tends to pass off as an oxide of
carbon, if carbon be present.</p>

<p>At somewhat lower temperatures nitrogen is very active and the
nitrides of many metals are readily formed. An excellent example is
shown by heating a mixture of carbon and of an oxide of titanium
(titanic acid). When heated by a feeble current the acid is simply
reduced, forming a lower oxide of titanium; with a more powerful
current the mass is completely changed into the nitride of titanium, the
nitrogen coming from the air; with a very powerful current this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
changed into pure carbide, as the nitride cannot exist at the higher
temperature, and the nitrogen escapes, carbon taking its place. At
still higher temperatures hydrogen acts on many metals, forming
hydrides. The carbides and other compounds of some metals are not
stable at high temperatures, being reduced by gaseous carbon to the
free metals, which remain then in the gaseous form.</p>

<p>At that period of the earth’s history when the temperature was as
high as that easily obtained in the electric furnace, we have the sanction
of geologists for picturing the earth’s surface as an ocean of molten
matter surrounded by a glowing atmosphere. This molten surface must
have consisted of binary compounds such as those mentioned above, and
probably contained some refractory elements, metals and non-metals, in
the free state. The atmosphere contained free hydrogen, oxygen and
nitrogen, gaseous binary compounds like the oxides of carbon, metals
in the gaseous form and many non-metallic elements like sulphur and
chlorine. In the atmospheric region furthest removed from the molten
surface violent chemical reactions occurred between the heated elements,
forming compounds which were again dissipated into their elements by
the heat given off in the act of formation or radiated from the glowing
surface below.</p>

<p>Under the enormous pressure of this atmosphere the liquid surface
of the earth solidified at very high temperature. Whether the earth’s
mass solidified from the centre outward or by forming a solid crust over
a liquid interior, is a question to be decided by physicists and geologists.
We will consider only the outer crust and the atmosphere. As the
surface and the atmosphere above it gradually cooled, the formation
of nitrides, and later of hydrides, sulphides and chlorides, occurred.</p>

<p>The conditions now attained may have been fairly stable as long
as the temperature of the surface and lower regions of the atmosphere
were high enough to prevent the union of the atmospheric oxygen
and hydrogen, or to decompose the water forming in the outer regions
of the atmosphere. As soon, however, as by further cooling, water
came into contact with the earth’s surface, very violent reactions
occurred, which were supplemented by other equally violent reactions
when the cooling process permitted the formation of the ordinary
mineral acids.</p>

<p>The reactions of water and of acids on many of the binary compounds
are so important in determining the present composition of
the earth’s crust that they must be considered in detail. The carbides,
nitrides, chlorides, sulphides and hydrides of most elements, and some
silicides, are decomposed by water, or else by dilute acids, forming the
hydrogen compounds of carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur and silicon
respectively, and the oxide or hydroxide of the other element. Thus
calcium carbide and water give calcium hydroxide and acetylene, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
hydro-carbon. Aluminum carbide yields alumina and methane (marsh
gas), another hydro-carbon, the chief constituent of ‘natural gas.’
Other carbides yield crude petroleum. The nitrides yield ammonia,
which is the hydrogen composed of nitrogen. The chlorides give
hydrochloric acid, the sulphides sulphuretted hydrogen and the silicides
the hydrogen silicide. The metallic hydrides yield free hydrogen.</p>

<p>The violence and the magnitude of some of these reactions almost
baffle the imagination. Let the reader drop a piece of calcium carbide
as large as a small marble into a little water in a cup; there is a rapid
action, a gas (acetylene) is given off, which burns with a smoky flame if
a lighted match is held over the cup. (The experiment should be tried
in the open air.) So much heat is generated in the reaction that the
cup becomes hot. Nearly four per cent. of the earth’s outer crust is
calcium; all this was at this period of the earth’s history in the form
of carbide. Imagine all the vast limestone mountain ranges of the
present day as carbide, and try to realize the effect when water fell on
any considerable area. The heat generated would be so enormous that
in a moment the acetylene would ignite and burn, forming oxides of
carbon and water vapor, which would in turn decompose, throwing the
jets of glowing hydrogen and oxygen vast distances into the atmosphere,
there to cool and reunite to water. The decomposition of other carbides,
of the hydrides and silicides, as well as the formation of
hydroxides by the action of the lighter metals on water, would produce
similar phenomena, as the substances formed are combustible gases,
or liquids or solids easily volatilized. This is no wild fantasy, but a
conservative statement. Similar reactions are taking place at the present
day in those stars whose cooling process has advanced far enough;
a case in point is that of the so-called ‘temporary stars.’</p>

<p>Extremely violent reactions are taking place constantly in the atmosphere
of the sun. The sun’s chromosphere, or outer layer of its
atmosphere, consists mainly of hydrogen, and jets of glowing hydrogen
are thrown to great heights above the chromosphere; these jets or
‘prominences’ have been frequently observed to have a height of 100,000
miles, and prominences of more than double this height are reported by
observers. The most conservative estimates assume temperatures of
the sun’s surface so enormous that that of the electric furnace is insignificant
in comparison, and we can have no conception of the chemical
changes occurring under such conditions. Whether one believes, with
Lockyer, that the chemical ‘elements’ are disassociated by the sun’s
heat into simpler substances or not, it is clear that very violent chemical
reactions are in progress, and if we realize that the known chemical reactions
increase in intensity with increase in temperature, it does not seem
strange that at the sun’s temperature the reactions occurring should
cause disturbances like those observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Returning to the earth, let us consider the products of these violent
reactions. The hydrogen and hydrides of boron, silicon, sulphur and
carbon, combined with the oxygen of the atmosphere, forming water
and boric, silicic, sulphurous and carbonic acids, which in turn acted on
the metallic oxides and hydroxides, forming sulphites, carbonates,
borates and simple and complex silicates; some quickly, some slowly,
some at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, others at high
temperatures in liquid or semi-liquid condition and under the pressure
of rock masses above. To determine the relative age of existing rock
layers, or the mode of their formation, whether by eruptive action, by
surface heat, by deposition of finely divided material under water, or
by metamorphic changes of the cooled silicate under subsequent action
of water, pressure and heat, is the province of the geologist. The
present writer refrains from an opinion whether any of the first formed
solid crust could or could not survive to the present day in its primary
form, considering the exposure to water, acids, heat and pressure which
it suffered.</p>

<p>Yet an idea may be formed of the condition of the earth’s surface
when it had cooled so far that the more violent chemical action had
ceased. It consisted chiefly of silicates, simple and complex; of some
of the original binary compounds, which are scarce affected by water
or acids, such as the silicide of carbon (carborundum), of stable oxides,
chlorides and sulphides, with other compounds in smaller proportion,
and free elements in greater proportion than at the present day.
Everywhere, from crevices in the surface, hydrocarbons, phosphoretted
hydrogen (phosphine) and ammonia were issuing as gases; the atmosphere
was heavy with these gases and with carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>No scientific observations thus far show <i>how</i> or from what definite
compounds plant life or animal life was first evolved from lifeless matter;
but it is certain that the materials were much more abundant and
the conditions more favorable at the period when it <i>was</i> evolved than at
the present day. An ocean much warmer and less saline than now, a
damp atmosphere like that of a hothouse, an abundance of plant food
and a choice of raw material, were at hand. The chief foods required
for plant life are nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrates, carbon
dioxide, phosphorus as phosphates, sulphates of lime, of magnesia
and of the alkalies, and water. As to the raw material for the first
formation of the living cell, it is impossible to say what compounds of
carbon were employed; suffice it to note that the known simple and
complex binary compounds of carbon were there ready for use; the hydrocarbons,
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were oozing from the
earth’s surface, from the ocean floor as well as from the land, or hanging
heavy in the air above it. If warmth or increased pressure were desiderata,
an ocean warm to its greatest depths could afford any pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
required. From the decomposition of the nitrides and phosphides
below the surface, ammonia and phosphine were escaping into the ocean
and into the air. The conditions then during long periods of time were
especially favorable for marine life, and as sand and mud accumulated
on the rocky surface of the earth, for land plants; the absence of a thick
soil being more than compensated for by the abundance of plant food,
notably of carbon dioxide and ammonia.</p>

<p>The statement may be found in excellent modern text-books of
chemistry that ammonia is always formed by the decomposition of
plants and animals, accompanied by the further statement that ammonia
is a requisite for plant food. No plants&mdash;no ammonia; no ammonia&mdash;no
plants. If this were true, the beginning of plant life would indeed
have been a struggle for existence; that it is not true is shown above.
This decomposition of nitrides has ceased practically on the actual
surface of the earth at the present day because the nitrides have all been
decomposed; yet it may be mentioned that specimens of rock freshly
quarried in Sweden were recently found to give off ammonia when wet
with water, showing the presence of nitrides. Below the actual earth’s
surface it is probable that nitrides still exist in large quantity, for
ammonia is one of the constituents of volcanic gases; to believe that volcanic
ammonia is a product of plant or animal decomposition is difficult;
to suppose it formed by the action of steam on nitrides in the earth’s
interior is simple.</p>

<p>Much the same may be said of the presence of carbides. While they
no longer exist on the surface, there is no doubt of their existence
in the interior of the earth, and the volcanic gases contain their decomposition
products. In this connection the theory&mdash;first put forward by
Mendelèeff and since supported by Moissan&mdash;of the origin of petroleum,
may be mentioned. These writers favor the hypothesis that it was
formed by the decomposition of carbides by water under pressure; and
while the evidence at hand perhaps favors the belief that the petroleum
of the more important oil fields owes its origin to decomposition of the
lower forms of marine animal life, yet there can be no doubt that
petroleum may be formed by carbide decomposition, and it seems probable
that natural gas is in part at least a result of the same action.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Partly</span> in deference to the report of the United States Weather
Bureau, from which it appeared that the chance of a fair eastern
sky on the morning of the eclipse was about 8 to 1, and after examination
by Mr. Abbot of many stations in North Carolina, Wadesboro, of
that State, was selected early in April as the site of the Smithsonian
observations. The advantages of Wadesboro being also recognized by
Professor Young, of Princeton, Professor Hale, of Yerkes Observatory,
and the Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Bacon, of the British Astronomical Association,
it came about that four large observing parties, besides several smaller
ones and numerous excursionists from the surrounding country, were all
joined to produce at Wadesboro one of the largest company of eclipse
observers ever assembled for scientific purposes. It is a matter for
congratulation that the sky at Wadesboro upon the day of the eclipse
was cloudless and clearer than the average, so that the efforts of the
observing forces were not thwarted by any circumstances beyond their
control. The provisions of the Mayor and authorities of Wadesboro
for preventing intrusion before and during the eclipse, and thus securing
an undisturbed field of operations, deserve especial recognition.
Further than this, the many acts of courtesy and hospitality to the
visiting astronomers on the part of the townspeople will long be remembered
by the recipients.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian party proper consisted of thirteen observers, and
included Mr. Langley, Mr. Abbot, aid acting in charge of the Smithsonian
astrophysical observatory; Mr. Smillie, in charge of photography;
Mr. Putnam, of the United States Coast Survey; Mr. Fowle, Mr. Mendenhall,
Mr. Child, Mr. Draper, Mr. Gill, Mr. Kramer and Mr. Smith.
Included with these, the Rev. Father Searle and the Rev. Father Woodman
gave most valuable assistance. Mr. Hoxie, of Port Royal, S.&nbsp;C.,
and Mr. Little, of Wadesboro, rendered valued assistance to Mr. Putnam
during totality.</p>

<p>Professor Hale, of the Yerkes Observatory, was a member of the
party, while still in general charge of the Yerkes expedition, and his
counsel and aid were of the greatest service. Mr. Clayton, of Blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Hill Meteorological Station, occupied a part of the grounds of the
Smithsonian party.</p>

<p>The main object of investigation was, of course, the corona, and of
this, (first) a photographic and visual study of its structure; with,
(second) a determination by the bolometer whether appreciable heat
reaches us from it, and, if possible, an examination of the form of its
spectrum energy curve.</p>

<p>The writer had been particularly struck, when observing the eclipse
of 1878 on Pike’s Peak, by the remarkable definiteness of filamentary
structure close to the sun’s limb, and had never found in any photographs,
not even in the excellent ones of Campbell taken at the Indian
eclipse of 1898, anything approaching what he saw in the few seconds
which he was able to devote to visual observations at the height of
fourteen thousand feet. His wish to examine this inner coronal region
with a more powerful photographic telescope than any heretofore used
upon it, was gratified by the most valued loan by Prof. E.&nbsp;C. Pickering
of the new 12-inch achromatic lens of 135 feet focus, just obtained for
the Harvard College Observatory. This lens, furnishing a focal image
of more than 15 inches diameter, was mounted so as to give a horizontal
beam from a cœlostat clock-driven mirror by Brashear, of 18 inches
aperture, and used with 30-inch square plates. To supplement this
great instrument, a 5-inch lens of 38-feet focus, loaned by Professor
Young, was pointed directly at the sun. This formed images upon
11 × 14 plates moved in the focus of the lens by a water clock. Specially
equatorially mounted lenses of 6, 4 and 3-inch aperture, driven
by clock work, were provided for the study of the outer corona, and the
search for possible intra-mercurial planets.</p>

<p>For the bolometric work, the massive siderostat with its 17-inch
mirror, and a large part of the delicate adjuncts employed at the Smithsonian
Institution in recent years, to investigate the sun’s spectrum,
was transported to Wadesboro. The excessively sensitive galvanometer
reached camp without injury even to its suspending fibre, a thread of
quartz crystal 1-15,000 inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Besides these two chief aims (the photography and bolometry of
the inner corona), several other pieces of work were undertaken, including
the automatic reproduction of the ‘flash spectrum’ by means
of an objective prism with the 135-foot lens, the photographic study
of the outer coronal region, including provision for recognizing possible
intra-mercurial planets, already alluded to, visual and photographic observations
of times of contact, and sketches of the corona, both from
telescopic and naked-eye observations.</p>

<p>The assignment of the observers was as follows: Mr. Langley, in
general charge of the expedition, observed with the same 5-inch telescope
used by him on Pike’s Peak in 1878, which was most kindly lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
for this special comparison by Professor Brown, of the United States
Naval Observatory; C.&nbsp;G. Abbot, aid acting in immediate charge, assigned
with C.&nbsp;E. Mendenhall to the bolometer; T.&nbsp;W. Smillie, having
general direction of the photographic work, made exposures at the 135-foot
telescope; F.&nbsp;E. Fowle, Jr., assigned to the 38-foot telescope;
Father Searle, directing the assembled telescopes for the outer coronal
region, and for intra-mercurial planets, assisted by P.&nbsp;A. Draper and
C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;B. Smith, exposed two cameras of 3-inch aperture and 11 feet
focus, and two of 4½-inch aperture and 3½ feet focus, all four of these
telescopes being mounted on a single polar axis driven by an excellent
clock; De Lancey Gill, assisting Mr. Smillie, removed the flash spectrum
objective prism at second contact, and made a single long exposure with
a 6-inch photographic lens of 7½ feet focus equatorially mounted;
Assistant G.&nbsp;R. Putnam, who, by the kindness of the superintendent
of the United States Coast Survey, was detailed for <span class="locked">latitude,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> longitude<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a>
and time observations, also observed contacts, directed the striking of
signals by Mr. Little, and rendered other valuable services. Mr. Putnam
was assisted in recording contacts by Mr. Hoxie. R.&nbsp;C. Child,
observing with a 6-inch telescope of 7½ feet focus, made sketches with
special reference to inner coronal detail, and was in addition charged
with all electrical circuits for chronograph and automatic photographic
apparatus. Father Woodman, with 3½-inch telescope, observed contacts
and made sketches.</p>

<p>The first detachment, consisting of Messrs. Abbot, Fowle, Kramer
(instrument maker) and Smith (carpenter), reached Wadesboro May
4th, and were soon joined by Messrs. Draper and Putnam. The latter
returned to Washington after a short but satisfactory latitude and
longitude campaign, reaching Wadesboro again just before the eclipse.
Other members of the party reached camp on and after the middle of
the month. The first comers found a very satisfactory shed already
erected and piers begun. Not a day passed from the time of the arrival
of the apparatus, May 7th, to the day before the eclipse, that was not
fully occupied in perfecting the arrangements.</p>

<p>The most striking portion of the installation was the line beginning
at the northwest pier, with its equatorial and cœlostat, continued from
thence south of east by the two great diverging tubes of the 135-foot
telescope and spectroscope. These tubes were covered with white canvas,
presenting the appearance of two immensely prolonged ‘A’ tents,
ending beyond the photographic house, where the 38-foot telescope tube
pointed east and upward at an angle of 42° with the horizon. When
the equatorial, with its large special conical tube camera, with all this
long-branching extent of white canvas ending in the uplifted tube of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the 38-foot telescope, was seen in the light of the moon, the extensive
field with these preparations, exhibited a still more picturesque scene
than by day.</p>

<p>Less imposing, and perhaps more ungainly was the combination of
four great cameras under the main shed, designed to search for new
planets and to depict the outer corona. These might well be described
as like a cabin and outbuilding, mounted on a polar axis, yet, despite
their awkward proportions, they were made to follow very accurately.</p>

<p>The morning of the eclipse dawned cloudless and very fairly
clear. Deep blue sky, such as the writer had seen on Pike’s Peak, of
course, is not among the ordinary possibilities of an eclipse, but the
milkiness of the blue was less pronounced than is usual in the summer
season, and all felt that the seeing promised well.</p>

<p>At fifteen minutes before totality a series of rapid strokes on the
bell called every one to his post, and one minute before the expected
contact five strokes were given as a final warning. Coincidentally with
the actual observation of the second contact by Mr. Putnam, the first
two strokes upon the bell sounded, and the work began. After 82
seconds (the duration of totality from the Nautical Almanac was 92
seconds), three strokes were given as a signal to stop the long photographic
exposures. Scarcely more than five seconds after this the sun’s
crescent reappeared. The duration of totality, as observed by Mr. Putnam,
was approximately 88 seconds.</p>

<p>To visual observers the sky was notably not a dark one. No second
magnitude stars were observed with the naked eye, and most of the
on-lookers saw only Mercury conspicuously, though Venus was distinguished
at a low altitude and Capella also was seen. So high a degree
of sky illumination can not but have operated unfavorably in the study
of the outer corona or in the search for intra-mercurial planets, and
this is to be remembered in connection with what follows.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Before Totality.</span></h3>

<p>A deepened color in the sky, a fall of temperature and a rising
breeze were distinctly noticeable. No change in direction of the wind
was noted. Shadow bands were seen, but those who attempted to
measure their velocity found them too rapid and flickering for any
great exactness in this determination. There was tolerable unanimity
among independent observers as to their size and distance apart (about
five inches), though some thought this less as totality approached.</p>

<p>It was noticed that the birds grew silent just before and during
totality, but true to their nature, the English sparrows were last to be
still and first to begin their discussion of the eclipse, after the return
of light.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">During Totality.</span></h3>

<p>The attention of all visual observers was at once caught by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
equatorial streamers. Father Woodman’s comparison of the appearance
of a structure of mother of pearl was generally recognized as good, but
different observers differed on the color estimate. A yellowish green
tinge was noted by the artist of the party, Mr. Child, while to others
the light was straw colored or golden.</p>

<p>The general coronal form to the naked eye was nearly that of the
small <a href="#ip_307">annexed photograph</a>, which, though taken by one of the smaller
objectives, gives a good view of the relative intensities. The same extensions
of the equatorial corona could be followed by the naked eye
from 3 to 3½ solar diameters.</p>

<p>The visual telescopic observations of the writer gave little indication
of the finely divided structure of the inner corona which he had
noticed at Pike’s Peak. Structure, to be sure, was evident, but not in
such minute subdivision as had then been seen, and though one remarkable
prominence as well as several smaller ones was visible, the
coronal streamers did not give to the writer the impression of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
connected with these prominences, though the relationship of some of
them to the solar poles was abundantly manifest.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">After Totality.</span> <i>Results.</i></h3>

<p>Comparing notes after totality, all observers reported a successful
carrying out of the programme. The greatest interest centers in the
direct coronal negatives taken with the 135-foot telescope. Mr. Smillie
exposed six 30 × 30 plates during totality, with times ranging from one
half a second to sixteen seconds, and three others were exposed by him
immediately after the third contact.</p>

<p>At this writing only a part of the negatives taken have been developed.
Their general quality may be inferred from the examples here
given, after due allowance for the great loss suffered by translation onto
paper even with the best care.</p>

their features, appear in imposing magnitude and detail.</p>

<p>Many of what it is hoped will be the most interesting photographs
still await development, but Mr. Smillie’s thorough preparation is promising
adequate results.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Heat of the Corona.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Abbot, with aid of Mr. Mendenhall, appears to have measured
the heat of the corona, and in spite of previous efforts, this is probably
the first time that it has been really shown to exist. For five
minutes before second contact, the bolometer was successfully exposed
to the region of the sky close to the narrowing crescent of the sun
where the corona was shortly to appear. A diaphragm was interposed
in the beam having an aperture of only 0.4 sq. cm. Deflections,
rapidly diminishing from 80 to 6 mm. were obtained, the last being
about 40 seconds before totality. Then the diaphragm was opened to
290 sq. cm. and a negative deflection of 13 mm. was observed after
totality, where these positive deflections had just been found, showing
that the corona was actually cooler than the background which had
been used at the room temperature. Next the black surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
moon was allowed to radiate upon the bolometer, and the still larger
negative deflection of 18 mm. was observed.</p>

<p>The important result was that the corona gave a positive indication
of heat as compared with the moon.</p>

<p>This heat, though certain, was, however, too slight to be sub-divided
by the dispersion of the prism with the means at hand.</p>

<p>The negatives taken to depict the outer corona show from three
to four solar diameters extension for the longest streamers. The equatorial
‘wings,’ as they recede from the sun, are finally lost in an illuminated
sky, without any indication of having actually come to an end.</p>

<p>No attempt to carefully examine the plates taken for intra-mercurial
planets has yet been possible. It is, however, as has been remarked,
doubtful if the very faintest objects will be found, in consideration of
the considerable sky illumination during totality. However, Pleione
in the Pleiades (a star of the 6.3 magnitude), is plainly seen on one
of the plates, and some smaller ones are discernible.</p>

<p>On the whole, the expedition may be considered as promising to be
very satisfactory in its results, and that it was so is largely owing not
only to the efficient care of Mr. Abbot, but to the many gentlemen
who have assisted me with the loan of valuable apparatus, with counsel,
with voluntary service and with painstaking observation, to one and all
of whom I desire to express my obligations.</p>

MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE.</span></span></h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Abstract of a lecture delivered at the Medical Graduates’ College and Polyclinic, and printed
in the <i>Lancet</i> of May 19.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">This</span> lecture is devoted to a description of the parasite and of its
life cycles. The existence of a parasite in malarial disease has
been suspected for a long time, but only very recently have we had
absolute assurance that such a parasite exists. Some time in the
thirties Meckel described in the human blood certain black particles
which he found in leucocytes and in certain pale, leucocyte-like bodies
the nature of which he did not know. When he saw these bodies he
certainly saw the malarial parasite. His observations were repeated
and extended in the forties and the fifties by Frerichs and Virchow,
and they, too, undoubtedly saw the malarial parasite. But it is one
thing to see and quite another to recognize; discovery is recognition.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Laveran, Golgi, Marchiafava, Bignami and others
resulted in considerable knowledge of the life history of the malarial
parasite and of the correspondence between its life cycle and the clinical
cycle of the disease. Laveran discovered the parasite; Golgi described
the cycle of the tertian and quartan forms; the others added
new data, especially concerning the more malignant parasites. The
malarial parasite in its mature form has the appearance&mdash;I shall take
the tertian parasite as a type&mdash;of a mass of pale protoplasm occupying
practically the whole of the red blood corpuscles. Scattered through
this mass of protoplasm are a number of black specks or little rods of
intensely black pigment. Later in the life of the parasite a peculiar
thing happens: all these little specks of black pigment concentrate
usually towards the center of the organism whilst the pale protoplasm
arranges itself into little spherules, the whole constituting what is
known as the ‘rosette body.’ Later in the life of the parasite the surrounding
blood corpuscle breaks away and this rosette body floats free
in the liquor sanguinis and then breaks up into its constituent spores,
setting free at the same time the black pigment clump. Phagocytes
attack many of these free spores and probably absorb most of them, as
well as the little pieces of pigment. The result is the pigmented
leucocyte, so characteristic of malarial blood. A few of the spores
escape and in virtue of some peculiar faculty, which is not at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
understood, enter fresh blood corpuscles and appear there as pale specks
in the hæmoglobin. These pale specks, if watched in perfectly fresh
blood, are seen to be possessed of very active amœboid movement.
They throw out pseudopodia in various directions and wander about
through the hæmoglobin of the corpuscle. After a time they increase
in size by assimilating the hæmoglobin. By and by there appear
somewhere in the parasite those specks of black pigment which we saw
in the mature animal. Later they increase still further in size until
they come to occupy half, and finally nearly the whole, of the blood
corpuscle. Again there is concentration of pigment and the formation
of little sporules. This is the cycle, as described by Golgi, of the
tertian and quartan parasite. The cycle of the tropical or æstivo-autumnal
parasite corresponds in plan almost exactly with that of the
quartan and ordinary tertian parasite.</p>

<p>It was found that the life cycles of these parasites ran parallel with
the clinical cycle of malarial disease. It was found that when the
parasite had arrived at maturity the apyretic interval in an ague was
about to conclude, and that when the parasite had arrived at the
sporulating stage the patient had entered on the shivering stage of his
fever. During that and the succeeding hot and sweating stage the
spores had entered the red blood corpuscles, and when the parasite had
ensconced itself in the red blood corpuscle and begun to grow, the
fever had come to an end. It was found in tertian fever that the
cycle of the parasite took forty-eight hours to complete, exactly the
length of the cycle of the clinical phenomena. In quartan fever the
cycle took seventy-two hours, exactly the length of the clinical cycle of
that form of malarial disease. In the malignant or tropical fevers there
was found to be a similar correspondence between the cycle of the
parasite and the cycle of the disease. It was found that with each recurring
paroxysm of fever there was a renewal of the life of the parasite,
and that in this way the life of the parasite was continued from
period to period and from cycle to cycle for weeks or even, especially in
the case of quartan malaria, for months. Now this explains very well
the way in which the malaria parasite contrives to maintain its existence
in the human body, but it does not explain how it passes from host to
host, neither does it explain certain appearances that Laveran and everybody
else who has studied the subject have witnessed. In malarial
blood you sometimes see that peculiar body, the flagellated body,
which I have already alluded to as consisting of a sphere surrounded
by from one to six or seven long tentacles or arms in a state of continual
agitation. Neither does it explain the peculiar crescent-shaped
body which also so pointedly arrested Laveran’s attention....
Golgi’s scheme leaves the passage of the parasite from host to host and
also the nature of these two bodies unexplained. What relation have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
these two bodies to the life of the parasite? Their nature and purpose
do not receive any illumination from Golgi’s theory. You will
find in all forms of malarial infection, if you look enough, the flagellated
body; but, strange to say, you will not find it in malarial blood
immediately after it is withdrawn from the body. It is only after an
interval of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour, after the blood is
withdrawn that these flagellated bodies appear. Whence do they come?
If you make a preparation of malarial blood from a patient by pricking
the finger and spreading a little of the blood on a slide, fixing it
immediately with heat or alcohol and staining it, you will never see
any of these flagellated organisms. But if the slip be kept moist and
in a warm temperature for half an hour and then stained, the flagellated
bodies will be seen, proving that they develop only after the escape
of the parasite from the human body. Such a fact is very interesting
and obviously has some significance in connection with the life of the
parasite. Whence, I ask, come these flagellated bodies? If one of
the crescent-shaped bodies is observed continuously, the following
changes of shape may often be observed: It becomes shorter, loses
its crescent shape and gives off flagella, which may break off and swim
about by themselves. When they come in contact with a blood corpuscle
they straighten themselves out and indulge in a peculiar vibratory
movement, as if endeavoring to penetrate the corpuscle.</p>

<p>Many years ago King, in America, and others too numerous to
mention suspected that the mosquito had something to do with malaria,
but in what way they could not say. Not only civilized observers had
this suspicion, but the savage natives of certain tropical countries had
the same idea. Koch tells us that certain natives of German East
Africa who lived in a mountainous, and therefore non-malarial, part
noticed that when they descended to the malarial regions on the coast
they acquired a fever which they called ‘mbu.’ They said that
they were bitten there by certain insects which they also called ‘mbu’&mdash;mosquito
or gnat. They give the same name to the mosquito and
to the fever, therefore obviously these savages associate the insect and
the fever as cause and effect. Peasants in certain parts of Italy have
the same idea, believing that the bite of the mosquito may be followed
by the development of malarial fever.</p>

<p>Laveran, some years ago, in one of his numerous works on malarial
fever, said that possibly the malarial parasite was cared for by the
mosquito in the same way that the latter cares for the filaria of the
blood. He did not, however, formulate a definite theory on the
subject.</p>

<p>In 1894 I was engaged in working at malaria, following out Golgi’s
work and that of other Italians. I was particularly struck by the
phenomena of exflagellation and more particularly by the fact that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
occurred only when the blood had been removed from and was outside
the human body. I reasoned that if this exflagellation occurs only
outside the body, the purpose of the flagellated body must lie outside
the human body, and that therefore the flagellated body must be the
first phase of the malarial parasite outside the body, must be the first
step that the malarial parasite takes in passing from one human host
to another. There seemed to me to be a sort of logic in this. But
how was the malarial parasite to pass from one human being to another?
It was not provided while inside the human body with any organs of
locomotion or penetration; as far as we know the parasite is never
extruded in the excreta, neither does it habitually escape in hæmorrhages.
Therefore, the idea of a spontaneous escape of the parasite
from the human body had to be dismissed. I therefore concluded that
some extraneous agency must remove the parasite from the human
body, so as to afford the opportunity for this flagellation which I had
concluded must constitute the first step in its extra-corporeal life. In
casting about for an organism which could effect this removal I, for
many reasons similar in some respects to those that influenced the
savage African, the Italian peasant, King, Laveran and others, came
to the conclusion that the medium of removal and transit must be
the mosquito. I was so impressed with the probabilities of this double
hypothesis and with its extreme practical value, should it prove to be
correct, that I endeavored to leave England for a time and to visit
British Guiana or some such suitable malarial country where I might
work out the idea. Unfortunately, that could not be accomplished,
so I published my theory in the hope that it would appeal to someone
who might enjoy the opportunities denied to me. At that time
Surgeon-Major Ross was at home from India and we had many conversations
on the subject. I described to him my hypothesis, the
probabilities of which and the possibilities of which powerfully appealed
to his highly logical and practical mind. He undertook, when he returned
to India, to do his best either to establish or confute it. Accordingly
he set to work in India experimenting with mosquitoes and
malaria.</p>

<p>Ross was stationed in Secunderabad, in the south of India, where
there was abundant opportunity for experimental work&mdash;plenty of
patients and plenty of mosquitoes. He got patients with crescent
parasites in their blood and he got mosquitoes to bite them. He found
that in the course of a few minutes after the blood had entered the
insects’ stomachs the crescent parasites proceeded to the formation of
sphere and flagellated body. But he got no further. This experiment
was repeated hundreds of times. Many of his preparations were sent
to me, and I could confirm from them the accuracy of his statements
on the subject. Ross was encouraged, for obviously we were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
right track. One day Ross, whose station had in the meantime been
changed, caught some mosquitoes which had been feeding on a patient
the subject of tertian malaria. He kept the mosquitoes and after a
few days dissected them. He took the stomach out and placed it on a
slip with a little salt solution, covered it with a cover-glass and examined
it with a microscope. He was gratified to find lying amongst the transverse
and longitudinal muscular fibres a number of spherical bodies,
very sharply defined, and including a great many grains of intensely
black pigment exactly like those of the malaria parasite. Ross was at
once struck with the similarity. After years of labor he believed he
had at last seen the malaria parasite in the tissues of the mosquito,
where we reasoned it ought to be; and he was right. At a subsequent
experiment on the malarial patient he found exactly the same bodies,
and on dissecting several mosquitoes at different intervals of time he
found that the parasite, which originally was six micro-millimetres in
diameter only, grew to sixty or eighty micro-millimetres, each parasite,
notwithstanding its growth and the lapse of time, still containing the
peculiar and most characteristic black pigment. Ross was now quite
sure that he had found the extra-corporeal phase of the malarial parasite.
Some of these preparations he sent home. I examined them
and showed them to a number of friends in London familiar with the
malarial parasite; they agreed with me, as Laveran also did, in believing
that probably this indeed was the long-sought-for extra-corporeal
phase of the malarial parasite. Ross at that time had great difficulty
in getting opportunities for experiment on the human subject and in
procuring proper mosquitoes. He found that the mosquitoes in which
he had discovered these pigmented bodies were of a different species to
those on which he had formerly experimented, and that in this circumstance
lay the explanation of his lack of success earlier as well as
the secret of his ultimate success. Failing to get sufficient opportunity
for experimenting on human malaria he turned to bird malaria. He
found that the sparrow of Calcutta, in a large proportion of instances,
contained in its blood a malaria-like parasite. Ross procured a number
of infected sparrows and let loose upon them a number of mosquitoes
of a species belonging to the genus <i>culex</i>. These mosquitoes, after
from one to ten days, he dissected and examined their stomachs. He
found in the stomach-wall pigmented bodies exactly similar to those
which he found in the stomach-walls of mosquitoes fed on human
malarial blood. He found that they increased in size and in a week
or ten days grew from six to eighty micro-millimetres in diameter.
When they became of considerable size they protruded like warts from
the surface of the insect’s stomach and were included in a very definite
capsule. At this stage the capsule was filled with a vast number of very
minute rod-like bodies. These capsules, which now projected into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
body cavity of the insect, being over-distended, ruptured and discharged
the rod-like bodies into the body cavity of the mosquito. For a time
Ross could get no further than this. He could not find what became
of the rod-like bodies. One day, in dissecting the head of a mosquito,
he encountered two small trilobed glands the ducts from which united to
form a main duct. The glands lay on either side of the head and the
common duct he traced to the base of the proboscis of the mosquito.
This was the salivary gland of the mosquito. He found that the cells
of the gland contained rod-like bodies exactly like those which he had
found inside the parasitic capsules in the stomach-wall. He concluded
that somehow these ‘germinal rods’ (for so he called them) had managed
to find their way into the salivary gland of the mosquito. It immediately
occurred to him that this might be the route by which the parasite
escaped from the mosquito into its vertebrate host. No sooner
had the idea occurred to Ross than he put it to the test of experiment.
He selected a number of sparrows in whose blood he satisfied himself
that there were no parasites and let loose upon them a number of
mosquitoes which he had already infected with malarial parasites. He
found after a week or ten days that the sparrows which were experimented
upon sickened and many of them died; and in their blood he
found the malarial parasite.</p>

<p>We now understand why the flagellated body is developed outside
the human host: because its function lies outside the human host. We
now understand why the flagella break away and enter the granular
sphere: they impregnate it and start it on the road of development.
We now understand why MacCallum’s vermicule is beaked and endowed
with powers of locomotion and penetration: that it may approach and
penetrate the stomach of the mosquito. And we now know why the
sporozooites, the ‘germinal rods,’ enter the mosquito’s salivary gland:
that they may be injected into vertebrate issue and so pass the parasite
from vertebrate to vertebrate.</p>

<p>This is one of those fairy tales of science which people are inclined
to doubt, but any one who has worked at the subject and taken the
trouble to go through the long series of preparations which have been
sent home from India can not for a moment have the slightest doubt
that what Ross stated was absolutely true, and that not only for bird
but for human malaria. So soon as the idea got abroad that the key
to the way in which the malarial parasite is propagated had been found
the Italians immediately set to work with renewed vigor and with the
utmost skill. Almost at once they demonstrated that what happened
in the case of Ross’s sparrows happened also with the human subject:
that the appropriate species of mosquito fed upon the human malarial
subject and subsequently allowed to feed upon a non-malarial subject
conveyed the malarial parasite and malarial disease, and that the appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
species of mosquito belonged to the genus anopheles. There
can not be the slightest doubt that the mosquito acts the part of transmitting
agent as well as definitive host of the malarial parasite.</p>

<p>This is a piece of knowledge of the utmost importance to mankind,
for we know that malarial disease in tropical countries&mdash;which, after all,
in the future will be the most important parts of the world, seeing that
they can produce more food than temperate countries and can therefore
support a larger population&mdash;causes more deaths and more disposition
to death by inducing cachectic states predisposing to other affections
than all the other parasites affecting mankind put together. We know
now in what way this parasite is acquired. Depend upon it, in time,
in virtue of this knowledge, we will get enormous power over the
disease and sooner or later we will be able to prevent the infection of
man by the parasite. It is only a question of study and the application
of the knowledge already acquired, only a question of money and perseverance
and a little ingenuity, and these results will come. It may
not be in ten years or twenty years, but sooner or later the energies
of a considerable portion of scientific mankind now being expended in
endeavoring to devise means for preventing the infection of men with
the malarial germ by the mosquito will bear valuable fruit.</p>

<p>You can readily understand that it is of great importance to be
able to recognize the special species of mosquito which convey malaria.
The effective species as regards human malaria belong to the genus
anopheles; species of the genus culex are effective in the case of
sparrow malaria. Fortunately, these two genera are easily recognized
even by the amateur zoölogist. If you find a mosquito clinging to the
wall or other surface you can tell which genus it belongs to by its
posture. If the body is stuck out nearly at right angles to the surface
on which the insect is resting, it is an anopheles. If the body is almost
parallel to the surface, it is a culex. There is another test which is
easily applied if you have a pocket lens; in culex the two organs known
as palpi are rudimentary and very short; whereas in anopheles those
organs are almost as long as the proboscis. It should be remembered
that the male mosquito is not a blood-sucker and therefore is not dangerous.
It is the female anopheles which transmits the disease. The
mosquito larvæ inhabit stagnant or slow-running water. If a mosquito
larva be found with its head downwards, the body hanging at right
angles to the surface of the water, it is a culex; if the body lies parallel
to the surface of the water, it is an anopheles. There are other points
of difference with which I need not now trouble you; those referred
to suffice for diagnosis between the innocuous and the dangerous
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The facts regarding the malaria parasite which I have described
are of great importance for many reasons. First, because they help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
us to understand the pathology and etiology of malaria. Secondly, they
help us in diagnosis. Thirdly, our knowledge of the parasite is invaluable
in directing treatment. Lastly, a knowledge of the life-history
of the malarial parasite is of extreme value for the prevention of
malarial disease, for could we by mechanical or other arrangements
prevent the mosquito attacking the human body, we could prevent
the malarial parasites from entering the human body; or if we could
abolish the mosquito by drainage or other means from a country, then
we might be sure that we would abolish the malaria of that country also.</p>

<p>Attempts are being made to solve these practical problems. At the
present moment such attempts are being actively made in Rome by
Professor Celli and elsewhere by others. I have no doubt that in the
course of a few years we shall get some very valuable results in this
direction and that, thanks to this new-born knowledge about the
malarial parasites, better times are rapidly approaching for malarial
countries.</p>

<h2 title="New Sources of Light and of Röntgen Rays" id="new">NEW SOURCES OF LIGHT AND OF RÖNTGEN RAYS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By HENRY CARRINGTON BOLTON, Ph. D.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> the general laws of physical science, none seems more
firmly established than that of the conservation and correlation
of energy; according to this the various forms of energy that constitute
the domain of experimental physics, heat, light, electricity, magnetism
and chemical action, have reciprocal dependence and “can not originate
otherwise than by devolution from some preëxisting force,” or rather
energy. That motion is convertible into heat, heat into light and both
the former into electricity are phenomena familiar to every one who
uses incandescent bulbs or rides in a trolley, and we do not usually
recognize any production of light unaccompanied by heat. True, the
little fire-fly is possessed of a mysterious power that enables it to emit
light without enough heat to affect Langley’s most sensitive bolometer,
but the eminent Secretary of the Smithsonian has to admit that the
“cheapest form of light” is produced by “processes of nature of which
we know nothing.” This little understood property called phosphorescence
is shared by many living organisms, both animal and vegetable,
as well as by substances of the mineral kingdom; to the former belong
coelenterates, mollusks, crustacea, fishes and insects, and decaying
wood, certain mushrooms, etc.; to the latter the Bologna stone, so-called,
and the commercial article called ‘Balmain’s paint.’</p>

<p>In the case of the mineral substances, barium or calcium sulfids
and the like, the light-giving power is not an innate property, but is
set in operation by exposure to the energy of sunlight, the light of
burning magnesium or to some other source of actinism; moreover,
the power thus acquired by insolation is a fugitive one, the substances
exercising it after three or four hours become ‘dead’ and lose their
activity. Excepting then these living beings and these phosphorescent
bodies, light as commonly known to us is always correlated with heat;
within the last four years, however, discoveries have been made in
France that seem to modify the position taken by philosophers and to
necessitate new views concerning the manifestations of that energy with
which the universe is endowed. A group of French savants have found
mineral substances that apparently give out light perpetually without
any exciting cause, realizing the dream of the alchemists&mdash;a perpetual
lamp consuming no oil. These substances also emit rays having the
penetrating properties of X-rays, other rays affecting a photographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
plate, and fourthly, rays causing air to become a conductor of electricity.
The history of these discoveries can be briefly given.</p>

<p>Röntgen’s discovery of the rays that pass through metals and solids
opaque to light was made in 1895, and in the following year, Becquerel,
a distinguished French academician, discovered that salts of the metal
uranium (substances that had long been used in coloring china and
glass) emit invisible radiations capable of discharging electrified bodies
and of producing skiagraphic images on sensitive plates; he found that
potassio-uranic sulfate emits rays that pass through black paper and
give photographic impressions in the same way as Röntgen rays. This
property is not limited to the brilliantly fluorescent uranic salts, but is
shared by the non-fluorescent uranous salts, and is exhibited by compounds
whether phosphorescent or not, whether crystalline, melted or
in solution, as well as by the metal itself. The permanence of this
activity is amazing, substances kept in a double leaden box more than
three years continuing to exert the power.</p>

<p>Shortly after the announcement by Becquerel, experimenters found
that other substances have the power of emitting ‘Becquerel Rays,’
such as calcium and zinc sulfids and compounds of thorium. In 1898
Mme. Sklodowska Curie, working in the laboratory of the Municipal
School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris, devised a special
apparatus for measuring the electrical conductivity of the air when
under the influence of ‘radio-active bodies,’ and by its means studied
the behavior of pitchblende (uraninite), and of other uranium minerals;
finding that some specimens of pitchblende had three times as much
energy as uranium itself, she came to the conclusion that the peculiar
property is due to some unknown body contained in the minerals and
not to uranium. Examining the mineral with the aid of her husband,
the two found a substance analogous to bismuth, four thousand times
stronger than uranium, which was named ‘Polonium,’ in honor of the
native land of Mme. Curie. In December of the same year, the lady
received the Gegner prize of 4,000 francs awarded by the Academy of
Sciences, as a substantial appreciation of her discovery, and later in the
same month Mme. and M. Curie announced that they had found a
second body in pitchblende, which they named ‘Radium.’ More recently,
M. Debierne, working under the auspices of Mme. Curie, has
discovered a third body, which he calls ‘Actinium,’ an unfortunate
appellation because ‘actinium’ has already been used for an element
announced by Dr. Phipson and since discarded.</p>

<p>These three ‘radio-active’ substances do not possess identical properties;
their rays are unequally absorbed and are differently affected in
a magnetic field; moreover radium emits visible rays, while polonium
does not. Nor have they the same chemical affinities; polonium belongs
to the bismuth group, radium to the barium and actinium to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
titanium series. They have not been separated perfectly from their
analogues, and consequently their chemical properties and the actual
intensity of their physical activities is very imperfectly known. The
difficulties of securing even small quantities of crude materials are
enormous; Fritz Giesel obtained from one thousand kilograms of raw
material only fifteen grams of active compounds, and Mme. Curie,
operating on half a ton of the residues of uranium from a chemical
manufactory, got about two kilograms of barium chloride rich in radium,
but the percentage of active substances in these mixtures is unknown.</p>

<p>Radium is spontaneously luminous, and all the bodies emit rays
that excite phosphorescence in gems, fluorite and other minerals; they
communicate radiant energy to inactive substances, and they exert
chemical action, transforming oxygen into ozone and producing changes
in the color of glass and of barium platino-cyanid.</p>

<p>Through the enterprise and liberality of the Smithsonian Institution,
and by the courtesy of Professor Langley, I have enjoyed the
opportunity of studying small specimens of these rare and costly substances;
they comprised ten grams of ‘radio-active substance’ prepared
by a manufacturing chemist of Germany and smaller quantities of
‘radium’ and of ‘polonium’ from Paris. On removing the wrappings
of the German specimens in a dark room, they were seen to emit
greenish-white light that gave to the enveloping papers a peculiar glow,
similar to the fluorescence produced by Röntgen rays. Simple tests
of the radium showed that it gave the usual reactions of barium; on
boiling it with water it lost its luminosity, but on heating to dull redness
this property returned in the dark. It also caused a barium platino-cyanid
screen to fluoresce.</p>

<p>Experiments to test the actinic power of these bodies gave interesting
results; on exposing sections of photographic plates, at distances
of five inches, from two to twelve minutes, bands were obtained varying
in intensity with the duration of action. By exposing sensitive plates
behind negatives to the radiant materials from two to three hours,
excellent transparencies were secured; on substituting Eastman’s bromide
paper good prints were obtained.</p>

<p>The penetrating power of the rays emitted permits the production
of skiagraphs; the plates were enveloped in Carbutt’s black paper
(impermeable to light), and on them were laid pieces of tinfoil cut in
openwork pattern; after one hour’s exposure negatives were secured
plainly showing the pattern. Analogous experiments were carried on
with the specimens from Paris, but they were only one fifth as strong
in effects; that labelled ‘polonium sub-nitrate’ had positively no action
on the plates used.</p>

<p>The primary source of the energy manifested by these extraordinary
substances has greatly puzzled physicists, and as yet remains a mystery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Mme. Curie, speculating on the matter, conjectured that all space is
continually traversed by rays analogous to Röntgen rays, but far more
penetrating, and not capable of being absorbed by certain elements
of high atomic weight, such as uranium and thorium. Becquerel,
reflecting on the marvellous spontaneous emission of light, said: “If
it can be proved that the luminosity causes no loss of energy, the state
of the uranium is like that of a magnet which has been produced by an
expenditure of energy and retains it indefinitely, maintaining around
it a field in which transformation of energy can be effected; but the
photographic reductions and the excitation of phosphorescence require
an expenditure of energy, of which the source can only be in the radio-active
substances.” Somewhat later, Becquerel hazarded the opinion
that the radiation is composed at least in part of cathodic rays; but
these have been proved to be material, hence the induced activity must
be caused by material particles impinging upon the substances excited.
This materialistic theory seems to be confirmed by the results of ingenious
experiments made by Mme. and M. Curie; they placed a
sensitive plate beneath a salt of radium supported on a slab of lead,
in the vicinity of an electro-magnet. Under these conditions, when
the current was passing, the rays emitted were bent in curved lines
upon the sensitive plate, making impressions.</p>

<p>It may be objected, says a French writer, that the materialistic
theory requires us to admit actual loss of particles of matter, nevertheless
the charges are so feeble that the most intense radiation yet
observed would require millions of years for the removal of one
milligram of substance.</p>

<p>While writing these lines, we have news of experiments that seem to
throw doubt on the elementary character of these radio-active bodies;
Bela von Lengyel, of Budapest, claims to have prepared the so-called
‘radium’ synthetically. By fusing with the heat of electricity uranium
nitrate mixed with a small percentage of barium nitrate, and treating
the mass with acids, he obtained a substance that gives out actinic rays,
Röntgen rays, excites platino-cyanid screens and causes air to conduct
electricity; in short, the Hungarian chemist gets material possessing
all the properties characteristic of the ‘element’ announced by Mme.
Curie.</p>

<p>Admitting that radio-active bodies can be manufactured to order,
are we any nearer explaining their mysterious powers?</p>

<p>Speculations as to the future history and applications of these
wonder-working bodies press upon even the dullest imagination; if a
few grams of earth-born material, containing only a small percentage
of the active body, emit light enough to affect the human eye and a
photographic plate, as well as rays that penetrate with X-ray power,
what degree of luminosity, of actinism and of Röntgenism (if the term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
may be allowed), is to be expected from an hundred weight of the
quintessence of energy purified from interfering matter? And to what
uses is this light-generating material to be applied? Are our bicycles
to be lighted with discs of radium in tiny lanterns? Are these substances
to give us the ‘cheapest form of light?’ Are we about to
realize the chimerical dream of the alchemists?</p>

<p>Seriously, in what direction is profound study of these substances
going to lead us? Will it not greatly extend our knowledge of physical
manifestations of energy and their correlation? In what corner of the
globe will be found the cheap and convenient supply of the raw material
yielding the radio-active bodies? Will not chemists be obliged to re-examine
much known material by laboratory methods conducted in
the dark? Many of us have worked up pounds of pitchblende to
extract the uranium oxids, and in so doing have poured down the
waste-pipe or thrown into the dust-bin the more interesting and precious
bodies.</p>

<p>Whatever the future may bring, scientists are deeply indebted to
Becquerel and to Mme. and M. Curie for placing in their hands new
methods of research and for furnishing a novel basis for speculation
destined to yield abundant fruits.</p>

<h2 title="Discussion and Correspondence" id="discussion">DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<h3><i>WASHINGTON AS AN EXPLORER AND SURVEYOR.</i></h3>

<p>Washington was a surveyor and explorer
before he entered upon the fields
of war and statecraft, and his honesty
of purpose, sincerity of action and accuracy
of statement and method, so
manifest throughout his career as a
soldier and statesman, are found also
in the earlier record. At the age of
sixteen he crossed the Blue Ridge on
horseback and made a series of successful
surveys in the Shenandoah valley,
overcoming physical obstacles with the
method and system of a modern scientist.
At twenty-two he led a party into
the wilderness of the valley of the Ohio
to treat with the French and Indians.
He then became acquainted with the
great resources of the interior, and saw
that the valleys of the James and Potomac
afforded unusual facilities for
lines of transportation for the trade ‘of
a rising empire.’ In 1754 he reported
in favor of a scheme of communication
between the Atlantic states and the
great west. Sixteen years later he suggested
that the project of opening up
the Potomac be ‘recommended to public
notice.’ The idea contained in the Potomac
scheme was of far-reaching import,
and only the present generation
can fully realize its significance.</p>

<p>Washington was not only the first to
map and recommend the general route
of the great highways called the National
Pike and the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal, which are now in truth
‘becoming the channels of conveyance
of the extensive and valuable trade of a
rising empire,’ but he was also the first
to predict the commercial success of
that route through the Mohawk valley
which was afterwards taken by the Erie
Canal and the New York Central Railroad.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifteen years ago he
asked: “Would it not be worthy of the
wisdom and attention of Congress to
have the western waters well explored,
the navigation of them fully ascertained
and accurately laid down, and a complete
and perfect map made of the
country.... The advantages
would be unbounded, for sure I am that
nature has made such a display of her
bounties in those regions that the more
the country is explored the more it will
rise in estimation, consequently greater
will the revenue be to the Union.”
Again he declared, “I shall not rest contented
until I have explored the western
country and have traversed those lines
which have given bounds to a new
empire.”</p>

<p>Washington did not do this as fully
as he wished, but his ambition has been
and is being realized through the medium
of hundreds of enterprises under
both national and private encouragement.
The result of a trip made in the
fall of 1784 was the real historic beginning
of the Potomac enterprise. On
his return he wrote to Benjamin Harrison,
Governor of Virginia, “I shall
take the liberty now, my dear sir, to
suggest a matter which would mark
your administration as an important
era in the annals of this country if it
should be recommended by you and
adopted by the Assembly.” He reached
far out for those days, assuming Detroit
as a point of departure for the
trade of the northwest territory. His
confidence in the practical abilities of
the American people is shown by the
remark, “A people who are possessed
with the spirit of commerce, who see
and will pursue their destinies, may
achieve almost anything. No person
who knows the temper, genius and
policy of this people as well as I do can
harbor the smallest doubt.”</p>

<p>In urging the Potomac scheme, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
later asked that commissioners be appointed
to make a careful survey of
the Potomac and James rivers to their
respective sources, and that a complete
map of the country intervening between
the seaboard, the Ohio waters and the
Great Lakes be presented to the people.
“These things being done,” he says, “I
shall be mistaken if prejudice does not
yield to facts, jealousy to candor and
finally, if reason and nature, thus aided,
do not dictate what is right and proper
to be done.”</p>

<p>He introduced his plan to the notice
of Congress, thus making the first
suggestion to that body of the policy
of national improvements which the
present generation is carrying on, as
well as of the policy of exploration and
national surveys to which our Government
so firmly adheres. To-day the
Government is carrying forward surveying
work by means of the largest
and most thoroughly equipped organizations
in existence, and thus is Washington
honored.</p>

<p>The scientific men of to-day owe to
Washington profound respect and gratitude
for the scientific spirit he cultivated
in his work. The Government
once established on so high a plane, it
necessarily followed that all true science
should be encouraged and be enlisted in
the development of the citizen and of
the material resources of the nation.</p>

<h3 id="tesla"><i>SCIENCE AND FICTION.</i></h3>

<p>The leading article of the June number
of the <i>Century Magazine</i> is entitled
“The Problem of increasing Human
Energy,” and is written by Nikola
Tesla. Mr. Tesla offers the reader some
naive verbal analogies between the
causes of human progress and the
‘energy’ of theoretical physics, and a
eulogy of a number of inventions which
he expects to make. He intersperses
these with sundry remarkable statements
such as, “our own earth will be a
lump of ice;” “Though this movement is
not of a translatory character, yet the
general laws of mechanical movement
are applicable to it;” “That we can send
a message to a planet is certain, that we
can get an answer is probable;” “It is
highly probable that if there are intelligent
beings on Mars they have long
ago realized this very idea [the transmission
of electrical energy for industrial
purposes without wires], <i>which
would explain the changes on its surface
noted by astronomers</i>.” (The
italics are our own.)</p>

<p>Mr. Tesla’s doctrine of human energy
is in some ways as original as the inventions
and discoveries which he expects
to make. Each of us is, he says,
a part of a unitary whole, ‘man.’ “This
one human being lives on and on....
Therein ... is to be found
the partial explanation of many of
those marvelous phenomena of heredity
which are the result of countless
centuries of feeble but persistent influence.”
Now we may “assume that
human energy is measured by half the
product of man’s mass with the square
of a certain hypothetical velocity ...
the great problem of
science is, and always will be, to increase
the energy thus defined....
This mass is impelled in one direction
by a force F, which is resisted by another
partly frictional and partly negative
force R, acting in a direction exactly
opposite, and retarding the movement
of the mass.”</p>

<p>Unhappily Mr. Tesla in his enthusiasm
to progress to recommendations
of religion, vegetarianism, the old régime
for women and the artificial preparation
of nitrogen compounds, neglects
to state which direction is the proper
one for the human mass to follow,
north, south, east, west, toward the
moon or Sirius or to Dante’s Satan in
the centre of the earth. Nor does he
explain how ‘enlightenment’ makes the
mass of human bodies go in an exactly
opposite direction to that toward which
‘visionariness’ impels them, nor reveal
why, if his account be true, he and a
‘visionary’ can walk in the same direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Of course the whole notion
that the ‘velocity’ of the human ‘mass,’
<i>i.e.</i> the space it traverses in a given
time, has any connection with human
progress or is of any value to anybody
or anything, is absurd.</p>

<p>Mr. Tesla has enjoyed considerable,
excellent repute as a gifted student of
certain electrical phenomena and one expects
a good deal from his “electrical
experiments, now first published.” Mr.
Tesla, too, expects a good deal from
them. It would take too long to even
note here all the important scientific
discoveries which Mr. Tesla expects to
make or all the benefits which he expects
to thereby confer upon mankind
in general and in particular upon
those who exploit his inventions. Some
samples may be given. War will be
rendered harmless by being reduced to
a sort of game between ‘telautaumata,’
machines which behave “just like a
blind-folded person obeying instructions
received through the ear,” any one of
which is “enabled to move and to perform
all its operations with reason and
intelligence.”</p>

<p>Says Mr. Tesla: “I purpose to show
that, however impossible it may now
seem, an automaton may be contrived
which will have its ‘own mind,’ and by
this I mean that it will be able, independent
of any operator, left entirely to
itself, to perform, in response to external
influences affecting its sensitive
organs, a great variety of acts and
operations as if it had intelligence. It
will be able to follow a course laid out
or to obey orders given far in advance;
it will be capable of distinguishing between
what it ought and what it ought
not to do, and of making experiences or,
otherwise stated, of recording impressions
which will definitely affect its
subsequent actions. In fact, I have already
conceived such a plan.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the interest in this
telautomatic warfare is to be purely
æsthetic, it would seem as if international
bull-fights or kite-flying or
spelling matches or potato-races might
do as well, and have the added advantage
of leaving Mr. Tesla’s expectations
free to wander among the following
prospective discoveries.</p>

<p>New sources of energy, Mr. Tesla
thinks, may be opened up, such as a
wheel which shall perform work without
any further effort on our part than that
of constructing it. “Imagine a disc of
some homogeneous material turned perfectly
true and arranged to turn in
frictionless bearings on a horizontal
shaft above the ground. This disk, being
under the above conditions perfectly
balanced, would rest in any position.
Now, it is possible that we may
learn how to make such a disk rotate
continuously and perform work by the
force of gravity without any further effort
on our part.... To make
the disk rotate by the force of gravity
we have only to invent a screen against
this force. By such a screen we could
prevent this force from acting on one
half of the disk, and the rotation of the
latter would follow.”</p>

<p>Into further particulars concerning
the nature of such a screen Mr. Tesla
does not enter, though it would seem a
matter well fitted to engage his peculiar
gifts. The ‘screen against gravity’ idea
has already entered into a popular
story, but scientific men have probably
not given it much consideration.</p>

<p>By producing a ‘sink’ or reservoir
of a low temperature, thereby inducing
the heat of the ambient medium to
transform itself in part into other forms
of energy (<i>e.g.</i> electrical), Mr. Tesla
hopes to “get any amount of energy
without further effort” beyond the
amount needed to create the ‘sink.’ We
should thus employ “an ideal way of obtaining
motor power,” and incidentally
rebuke the narrow-minded physics of
Carnot and Lord Kelvin.</p>

<p>By means of his electrical oscillator
Mr. Tesla has satisfied himself that he
can transmit electrical energy in large
quantities without wires. He expects
that this can be done to great economic
advantage. Then would come the golden
age. “Men could settle down everywhere,
fertilize and irrigate the soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
with little effort, and convert barren
deserts into gardens, and thus the
entire globe could be transformed and
made a fitter abode for mankind.”</p>

<p>The golden age figures largely in
Mr. Tesla’s article; he offers us all that
is entrancing and wonderful. He is
generous. We ask for the bread of definite
facts of science and intelligible
evidence, but he gives us the amethyst
and topaz and diamonds of an ambient
medium doing all our work and the atmosphere
transporting all our motive
power and the tyrant gravity held
powerless by a screen, and Mr. Tesla
correcting Lord Kelvin’s errors. Still
amethyst and topaz and diamonds are
only stones. They may dazzle the
magazine reader, but they do not
nourish the student of science.</p>

<p>The editorial department of the <i>Century
Magazine</i> perhaps felt that these
jewels were a bit too bright. We read
there that “much that must seem speculative
to the layman can take its proper
place only in the purview of the scientist.”
Some conservative scientists will
feel like growling, “And much that
must seem bosh to the man of science
can take its proper place only in the
purview of the editorial departments of
popular magazines.” Leaving aside the
present case, it is a fact that the same
care which is exercised by editors to secure
in their contributions excellence
of style and syntax, a proper moral tone
and freedom from advertisement of
business ventures, is not exercised to
secure accuracy in statements of fact or
decent credibility in matters of theory.
The editors apparently impute to their
readers a desire to be entertained at all
costs. They descend to a footing with
the Sunday newspaper instead of trying
to rise to the level of such scientific
literature as Huxley or Tyndall gave us.
They evidently often do not know
science from rubbish and apparently
seldom make any effort to find out the
difference. They should at least submit
their scientific literature to competent
men for criticism and revision.</p>

<p>The general public is helpless before
any supposedly scientific statement. It
may judge vaguely by the standing of
the paper or magazine or book containing
it, by the name of the writer or by
the general tone in which the article is
written. But it cannot judge definitely
by comparison with relevant facts or
by critically examining the logic of the
deductions, for the general public lacks
both knowledge of the relevant facts
and training in logical criticism. That
a man should invent a microscope which
will enable one to see objects a million
times as small as can be seen with the
naked eye seems no more questionable
to the general public than that a man
should cause unfertilized eggs to develop.
Yet the first would be impossible
while the second has been possible,
probable, and still more lately proved.
Guidance in scientific matters should be
welcome if only for the protection thus
given against fraudulent medicines,
bogus inventions and nonsensical enterprises.</p>

<h3><i>MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS.</i></h3>

<p>The memoirs presented to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society on the occasion
of the jubilee of Sir George
Stokes, have been published in a stately
volume by the Cambridge University
Press. A year ago some four hundred
men of science met at Cambridge to celebrate
the fiftieth anniversary of the appointment
of Sir George Stokes to the
Lucasian professorship of mathematics,
a chair held by Newton and a distinguished
line of mathematicians. An official
account of the proceedings, with
a portrait of Professor Stokes, is given
in the volume now issued. The seventy-two
institutions sending delegates are
arranged chronologically in the order
of their foundation, and it is not unworthy
of note that among the sixteen
oldest institutions, the United States
has five representatives, whereas Great
Britain has thirteen universities and colleges
younger than the Johns Hopkins
University. The Rede lecture given by
M. Alfred Cornu and entitled ‘La théorie
des ondes lumineuses,’ is published
in French, even the quotations from
Newton’s ‘Opticks’ being translated into
that language. M. Cornu states that by
‘une étude approfondie’ of the ‘Opticks,’
his lecture shows that Newton favored
Descartes’s undulatory theory of light,
rather than the emission theory usually
attributed to him. The twenty-two
memoirs that follow cover a wide range
of subjects, nearly all of which have,
however, a connection with the researches
of Professor Stokes. They include
three contributions from the
United States, mathematical papers by
Profs. E.&nbsp;W. Brown and E.&nbsp;O. Lovett,
and a description by Professor Michelson
of his echelon spectroscope.</p>

<p>In addition to this memorial volume,
the Cambridge University Press,
which is represented in America by
The Macmillan Company, is at present
publishing the collected papers of
three eminent students of mathematical
physics. The first volume of Lord
Rayleigh’s ‘Scientific Papers’ contains
seventy-eight contributions published
from 1869 to 1881. The early papers show
the influence of Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh’s
predecessor in the chair of experimental
physics at Cambridge, but it
was apparently not until 1881 that he
fully appreciated the importance of
Maxwell’s electro-magnetic theory of
light. The papers on acoustics were followed
by the publication in 1877 of the
classical work on the ‘Theory of Sound.’
Lord Rayleigh, at an early period,
treated various optical subjects, including
some of the phenomena of color vision.
His explanation of the blue color
of the sky and his treatment of the
resolving power of telescopes are well
known. The contributions on optics and
acoustics have been continued to the
present time, but they by no means
limit his interests. There are important
papers on hydrodynamics and mathematics,
and longer and shorter contributions
on a great range of subjects in
mathematical physics, the science which
at the present day is perhaps of supreme
importance.</p>

<p>The second volume of Professor
Tait’s ‘Scientific Papers’ contains those
published since 1881. The first volume
consisted of sixty papers, and this volume,
which has followed with but little
delay, adds seventy-three. As must be
the case in collected papers, some are
elaborate treatises while others fill only
part of a single page; some are extremely
technical while others were first
published in the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica’
and the ‘Contemporary Review.’
Among the more elaborate papers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
those on the physical properties of water
contributed to ‘The Voyage of H.&nbsp;M.
S. Challenger,’ on the kinetic theory of
gases, on impact and on quaternions.</p>

<p>The third series just published by
the Cambridge Press is the ‘Papers on
Mechanical and Physical Subjects’, by
Prof. Osborne Reynolds, of Owens College.
The first volume contains forty
papers from transactions and journals
issued from 1869 to 1882. The most
elaborate memoir is that on certain
dimensional properties of matter in the
gaseous state, which includes experiments
on thermal transpiration of gases
through porous plates and a theoretical
extension of the dynamic theory of gas.
Many of the papers, such as those on
meteorological phenomena and the
steering of vessels, are of popular interest.
The Cambridge University Press is
performing a work of the utmost value
to science in undertaking the publication
of these great volumes, and we can
only regret that, in spite of the beginnings
made at Johns Hopkins, Chicago,
Pennsylvania and Columbia, American
men of science have no such opportunities
for the publication of their works as
those afforded at Cambridge and Oxford.</p>

<h3><i>BOTANY.</i></h3>

<p>That a large amount of popular interest
centers in the study of tree life
and all subjects incidental to forestry
and horticulture is evidenced by the appearance
of a second book on the subject
under the title of ‘Our Native Trees
and How to Identify Them’ (Scribners),
by Harriet L. Keeler. The volume in
question takes up the trees native of
northern United States east of the
Rocky Mountains, together with a few
well-known foreign species which have
become naturalized in this region.</p>

<p>The book opens with a key to the
families of dicotyledonous species based
upon leaf characters, and every species
receives not only a full technical description,
but also comes in for interesting
comments upon habit and general
ecological relations. Numerous drawings
and half-tones add to the accuracy
and clearness of the descriptions. It is
not too much to say that the photographic
reproductions surpass in beauty
and presentation of detail any recent
botanical publication, and the venation
of leaves is shown in most instances by
this method quite as well as it might
be done by means of pen and ink
sketches. The value of the descriptions
is heightened by the inclusion of notes
of economic interest. It is not unexpected
that some errors should creep
into the discussions on almost all phases
of botany which are interspersed
throughout the volume.</p>

<p>The appearance of a new botanical
dictionary is most timely, and it is fortunate
that the task of its preparation
should be undertaken by such a skilful
bibliographer as Mr. B.&nbsp;D. Jackson.
His ‘Glossary of Botanical Terms’ (Lippincott)
contains fifteen thousand
words, or three times as many as have
been included in any previous work of
this character. This is indicative of a
most energetic pursuit of investigations
in all departments of the subject, and
also of a lamentable tendency to the
coinage by botanists of new and unnecessary
terms upon the slightest pretext.
A legitimate factor in the increase of
the contents of such a work consists in
the inclusion of words in common use
which take on a technical meaning in
botany; such, for instance, as altitude,
abnormal, abrupt, absolute, accidental
back, etc.</p>

<p>Derivations are given, but the history
of the terms has not been attempted.
According to the author,
‘anlage’ may be variously rendered as
<i>rudiment</i>, <i>inception</i> or <i>primordium</i>.
‘Chlorophyll’ receives the double consonant
at the end of the last syllable
against the popular extra-botanical
practice. Regarding ‘medullary’ the author
says: “I have given the accent as
it is always spoken (medul’-lary)
though all of the dictionaries (<i>botanical?</i>)
accent it as med’-ullary except
Henslow’s.” In this the author had in
mind the practice among his insular
colleagues only, since the latter pronunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
is given in the Standard,
Century and Webster’s Dictionaries and
is followed by nine tenths of the American
botanists. “Mycorhizome = mycorrhiza-like
structures in Corallorhiza and
Epipogum roots,” and “Mycorrhiza =
symbiotic fungi on the roots of plants,
prothallia, etc.,” are not only incongruous
with orthography and botanical
fact, but also with the usage of all recent
writers on this subject.</p>

<p>While many other errors of this
character could be adduced, the general
value of the book is scarcely lessened,
and it will be of the greatest service to
the working botanist, not only in raising
the general literary tone of his
writings, but also in placing at his
command a choice of all of the established
terms dealing with any phase of
the subject; an aid which will be
greatly conducive to increased accuracy
of statement.</p>

<p>A decade since, the majority of the
botanists engaged in the study of the
distribution of plants on this continent,
as well as the strict systematists, were
quite unanimously of the opinion that
the territory within the boundaries of
the United States had been quite thoroughly
explored, and that the task of
the collector are well-nigh done. Despite
this discouraging conclusion a few
enthusiastic workers have not intermitted
their labors in a more critical
consideration of the floras of the newer
and less thickly settled regions, with
the result that scores and hundreds of
new species have been brought to light
each year, and the awakening interest
in the subject promises a re-exploration
of the great West.</p>

<p>A striking example of the results
awaiting the student in this line is afforded
by Dr. Rydberg’s ‘Flora of Montana
and the Yellowstone Park’ (New
York Botanical Garden), which has recently
appeared. Although the first collections
of plants in this region were
made by the Lewis and Clarke expedition
nearly a century ago, Dr. Ryberg
finds 163 new species and varieties in
the 1,976 which he lists in this volume.
Of this number 487 are found on both
the eastern and western slopes of the
continental divide, 268 on the eastern
side only, 520 on the western side only,
42 of which are arctic and inhabit the
high mountain summits, and 659 which
have originated in the exact region under
discussion. Seven hundred and seventy-six
of the species listed were not
included in Coulter’s ‘Rocky Mountain
Botany,’ published a few years ago.</p>

<p>The symposium on the ‘Plant Geography
of North American,’ to be given
at the coming meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science, will do much to systematize investigations
of this character and
broaden the method of treatment accorded
the subject in the future.</p>

<h3><i>BIOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p>The ‘Biological Lectures from the
Marine Laboratory of Woods Holl,
1899,’ make up a volume of about three
hundred pages which represent fairly
the present tendencies of biological investigation
in this country. The most
striking things about the lectures are
the wide range of topics which they
treat, and the first-hand quality of the
subject matter in each case. This is
most clearly seen by a careful reading
of the text, but a mere enumeration
of a few of the sixteen titles and lectures
makes it fairly obvious. Thus,
D.&nbsp;P. Penhallow writes on ‘The Nature
of the Evidence Exhibited by Fossil
Plants, and its bearing upon our
Knowledge of the History of Plant
Life;’ D.&nbsp;T. MacDougal writes on the
‘Significance of Mycorrhizas,’ Edward
Thorndike on ‘Instinct,’ Herbert S. Jennings
on ‘The Behavior of Unicellular
Organisms,’ Alpheus Hyatt on ‘Some
Governing Factors usually neglected in
Biological Investigations,’ T.&nbsp;H. Morgan
on ‘Regeneration,’ C.&nbsp;B. Davenport on
‘The Aims of the Quantitative Study of
Variation,’ Jacques Loeb on ‘The Nature
of the Process of Fertilization.’</p>

<p>To the professed scientist these lectures
will furnish expert opinion on certain
important topics; the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
reader will find in them a presentation
not too technical or detailed. Professor
Loeb’s lecture, for example, is for such
readers the best account yet given of his
experiments in artificial fertilization.</p>

<p>The range and originality which
characterize these lectures are really
characteristic of the general work and
spirit of the Woods Holl Laboratory.
Few people realize the amount of research
work which is done there from
summer to summer. Yet last year
there were seventy-one investigators
there. Moreover, these represent a superior
selection from among the instructors
and students of the various
colleges.</p>

<p>It is a symptom of a healthy, vigorous
condition in biological science that
the best workers of the country are
glad to devote their vacation season to
research, and it is highly creditable to
the Woods Holl management that it
offers them such attractive facilities.
Similar summer laboratories are now
being established in other parts of the
country, and are to be reckoned with
as very important factors in the progress
of biology.</p>

<h3><i>CYTOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p>It is a somewhat surprising fact that
among educated people of scientific
training there prevails generally the
greatest ignorance as to some of the
most important problems of biology. We
refer to those problems connected with
the structure and functions of the animal
and plant cell. Men who can understand
and appreciate recent discoveries
in astronomy, physics, chemistry
and geology are usually wholly lost in
cytology. In fact, in general writing or
speech it is not safe to use this name
without at once defining it, since it is
commonly supposed to be a mispronunciation
or a stupid misspelling of ‘psychology,’
while to most people <i>nuclei</i>,
<i>chromosomes</i>, <i>centrosomes</i> and <i>mitotic
spindles</i> are words without meaning,
signifying nothing.</p>

<p>The reason for this is twofold: First,
cytology is one of the newest of the
biological sciences and it has but recently
found its way into college curricula,
and second, there have been few
text-books or general works on this subject
to which an intelligent layman
could turn for information.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of this fact, there are
few fields of scientific work possessing
more general interest than that of cytology.
At the present day the greatest
problems of biology are centered in the
cell. Assimilation, growth, metabolism,
reproduction, differentiation, inheritance
and variation&mdash;these are at bottom cellular
phenomena, the result of the structure
and functions of cells. It is not
surprising, therefore, that “all the
searchlights of science have been turned
upon the cell,” and that cell studies
during the past ten years have received
an amount of attention which is comparable
only to that devoted to evolution
under the stimulus of Darwin’s
work.</p>

<p>Professor Wilson’s book on the <span class="locked">cell,<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></span>
the second edition of which has just
appeared, is a work of more than ordinary
interest, not only to the biologist,
but to all persons who are interested in
the general advance of science. Although
there are several other good
text-books of cytology which have appeared
during the past five or six years,
Professor Wilson’s book, in thoroughness
of treatment, in philosophical insight,
in clearness and forcefulness of
style and in wealth and beauty of illustrations,
easily surpasses them all.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F" id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> The Cell in Development and Inheritance.
Edmund B. Wilson. Second Edition Revised
and Enlarged. Columbia University Biological
Series IV. New York and London, The
Macmillan Co., 1900. Pp. xxi, 483 with 194
Figures in the Text. $3.50</p></div>

<p>It is impossible in this brief note to
give any adequate summary of the volume
or of the position of the author on
questions of general interest; the subjects
of the chapters, however, may
serve to give some idea as to the scope
of the work. After an introduction
which gives a brief historical sketch of
the cell theory and its relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
evolution theory, there are taken up in
successive chapters a general sketch of
cell structure, cell division, the germ
cells, fertilization of the ovum, the formation
of the germ cells and the halving
of their nuclei preparatory to fertilization,
cell organs and their relations to
each other and to the life of the cell,
cell chemistry and cell physiology, cell
division in its relation to the development
of the egg, and finally, some
theories of inheritance and development.
In addition, there is appended an excellent
glossary and a list of all the
most important literature on the subject
up to the current year.</p>

<p>While the work is undoubtedly intended
as a reference book for investigators
and advanced students in biology,
being marked by the thoroughness of
treatment of an original communication,
it is yet so well written and so
copiously illustrated as to make it not
only intelligible but also intensely interesting
to the general reader.</p>

<h3><i>EDUCATION.</i></h3>

<p>The most important recent book on
education is undoubtedly ‘Education in
the United States,’ a book prepared in
connection with the educational exhibit
of this country at the Paris Exposition.
It consists of a series of monographs
which cover all the important phases of
educational endeavor in the United
States. The two volumes include nearly
a thousand pages, almost all of which
present definite and reliable facts. Only
rarely is there any indulgence in expressions
of private opinion, and still more
rarely is such opinion questionable. The
editor is justified in his statement that
the book is ‘a cross-section view of education
in the United States in 1900.’ It
will be of great value to the student of
American institutions or of education
in general, and should be of interest to
any citizen who desires to be well informed
about his country. The quality
of the monographs will be evident from
the list of the author’s names. For instance,
those writing on higher education
are Prof. A.&nbsp;F. West, of Princeton;
Prof. E.&nbsp;D. Perry, of Columbia; President
Thomas, of Bryn Mawr; Director
Parsons, of the University of the State
of New York; President Mendenhall, of
the Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
and Prof. H.&nbsp;B. Adams, of Johns
Hopkins.</p>

<h2 title="The Progress of Science" id="progress">THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<p>The conditions in the United States
have been favorable to the development
of geology. The varied forms of the land
have offered abundant opportunities for
research, whereas the practical value of
the work has led to the establishment
of surveys, the magnitude of whose contribution
to geology is only known to
special students. The Geological Society
of America has about two hundred
and fifty members, nearly all of whom
are actively engaged in geological research,
perhaps a larger number than in
any other science. The U.&nbsp;S. Geological
Survey is the center of this movement,
and its great efficiency is in large measure
due to Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Gilbert, now president
of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science. He was
born in Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y., in 1843, and
after graduating from the university in
that city, acted for five years as assistant
in the Ward Museum, where a
number of eminent naturalists have
been trained. He then became geologist
in the Ohio Survey under Newberry,
was engaged in the Wheeler and Powell
Surveys, and has been geologist in the
U.&nbsp;S. Geological Survey since its establishment
in 1879. In the arid west,
where the face of the earth is bare, Mr.
Gilbert made the observations and discoveries
in dynamical and physical geology
which have done so much toward
the making of the science of physiography.
His monographs on the Henry
Mountains and on Lake Bonneville, the
name he gave to the ancient lake that
once filled the Utah basin, are models,
both in regard to their original discoveries
and the methods of presentation. He
has extended his studies to the basins
of the Laurentian Lakes and to other
regions, always with important results.
Mr. Gilbert has been president of the
American Society of Naturalists, the
Geological Society of America and the
Philosophical Society of Washington,
and has received the Wollaston Medal
of the Geological Society of London.
His presidential address before the
American Association will be given at
the American Museum of Natural History,
New York City, on the evening
of June 26, his subject being ‘Geological
Rhythm.’</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The meeting of the American Association
in New York City, opening as
this issue of the <span class="smcap">Monthly</span> is published,
promises to be of more than usual importance.
The preliminary programs
of the different sections show long lists
of valuable papers and promise the attendance
of leading men of science from
all parts of the country. A movement
of interest is the increasing tendency of
special scientific societies to meet in
conjunction with the Association. No
less than fifteen societies will this year
hold their sessions at Columbia University,
some of them joining with the
sections of the Association, and others
holding independent meetings. The
members of these different societies
have the advantage of the reduced railway
rates and other arrangements
which can be made once for all, and the
still greater advantage of meeting scientific
men in other departments. As
science grows in details and in range,
there is on the one hand an increased
specialization, making it desirable for
small groups of experts to meet together
to discuss their special problems,
while, on the other hand, almost every
scientific question has ramifications extending
to many sciences. Hence, the
need of many separate societies and at
the same time of a common meeting
ground. When the American Association
was organized, in 1848, its members
could meet in one body; later they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
divided into two sections, one for the
exact sciences and one for natural history.
In 1882 nine sections were organized,
but it was not until 1892 that
botany was separated from zoölogy. At
present the sections no longer suffice,
and there must be either a further sub-division
and a more efficient organization
of the sections, or the American
Association must become an administrative
body, that will arrange for the
simultaneous meetings of independent
societies and the union of these societies
in support of their common interests.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The obvious advantages of meeting
together have now led nearly all the
national scientific societies to select
either the time of the American Association
or Christmas week for joint
meetings. It is unfortunate that they
should be divided into two groups, and
it must be admitted that neither midsummer
nor the Christmas holidays are
altogether suitable for the meetings.
The American Association has this year
made the experiment of selecting the
end of June, immediately after the close
of the college sessions, instead of a week
in August. This has some advantages,
but even at the beginning of the summer
many men of science are either
abroad or are engaged in scientific
expeditions. The heat is apt to be excessive,
interfering not only with the
meetings, but also requiring some self-sacrifice
on the part of scientific men
when they leave their comfortable summer
homes to travel through heat and
dust to a hot and dusty city. Christmas
week, divided by Sunday, is too short
for a series of scientific meetings, especially
for those who must travel from a
distance. This led to the organization
last winter of the Cordillerean Geological
Society, the Western Society of
Naturalists and the Western Philosophical
Association. Local associations are,
of course, valuable, but they should not
interfere with one central meeting in
the course of the year. The plan has
been suggested of taking one week,
either immediately after the New Year
or in the early spring, for a general
scientific gathering, which would include
not only the exact and natural
sciences, but also philology, history, etc.
The plan would be to secure an
adjournment of exercises or leave of absence
in the case of universities, colleges,
museums, Government departments,
etc., with the understanding that
it would be the duty of all those who
were released from their regular work

<p>The American Association last met
in New York City in 1887, though there
was a meeting in Brooklyn in 1894. The
past thirteen and even the past six
years have witnessed an extraordinary
development in the educational and scientific
institutions of the city. Columbia
College and New York University
have developed into great universities,
each having found a new site and
erected upon it buildings which might
have been expected to come only as the
growth of a century. The American
Museum of Natural History has become
one of the great museums of the
world, millions of dollars having been
spent on buildings. A botanical garden
and a zoölogical park have been established,
which promise to rival those of
any of the European capitals. A well-equipped
aquarium has been opened under
the auspices of the city; the Metropolitan
Museum of Art has been entirely
rebuilt to accommodate its increasing
collections; a magnificent
building is in course of erection for the
Public Library to contain its great assemblage
of books, which with its endowment
is largely the result of recent
years. While Boston and Philadelphia
have made great advances within the
last few years, and Washington has
become the chief scientific center of the
United States, it is especially noteworthy
that New York City has
enjoyed an educational and scientific
development commensurate with its material
resources.</p>

<p>Jonas G. Clark, who ten years ago
established at Worcester a university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
and christened it with his name, has
died and left to the university several
hundred thousand dollars, and on certain
conditions practically the whole of
his estate, which is said to be between
five and ten million dollars. The will is
a complicated document with numerous
codicils, somewhat difficult to interpret
and likely to give rise to legal complications.
The history of Clark University
has been curious and interesting. As
in the case of the Johns Hopkins University,
there was a difference of opinion
between the founder and the president
as to the scope of the institution.
In both cases the founder had in view
a more or less local college, while the
president believed that we had colleges
in sufficient number, but needed in the
United States universities on German
models, but going even further than
Germany in making research rather
than instruction the primary object of
the institution. Johns Hopkins died
very soon after the establishment of his
university, and though there was for a
while a good deal of difference of opinion
in the board of trustees, the university
idea triumphed. A college was,
however, established in connection with
it. At Clark University the founder
lived for ten years, and appears to have
altered several times his point of view.
He withdrew his support, and the university
work which began brilliantly
was much reduced in range and quality.
The greater part of the faculty removed
in a body to the University of Chicago.
It appears that at this time Mr. Clark
bequeathed his money to the university
only on condition that the president
should resign, but later devised a compromise
by which the university should
continue as at present, while a partly
independent college should be established
in conjunction with it. The interpretation
of the will, the value of the
estate and the development of the university
open problems that will only
be settled in the course of time.</p>

<p>Europeans who look upon the
United States as a material and commercial
nation must find it difficult to
interpret the great gifts that are continually
made for the cause of higher
education. Twenty-five years ago there
were in America no universities in the
sense in which the term is most properly
employed. During this comparatively
brief period the older institutions have
become universities, and the great increase
in expenditure has been met
chiefly by voluntary contributions. The
annual expenditure, for example, at
Harvard and Columbia Universities is
about a half million dollars beyond the
tuition fees, and the money invested in
grounds and buildings, is in the case
of either university many millions.
Then this period has witnessed the establishment
of new universities, rivaling
in endowment the older institutions.
The Johns Hopkins University and
Clark University have been mentioned
above, but the most noteworthy instances
are the University of Chicago,
to which one benefactor still living has
given eight million dollars, and Leland
Stanford Junior University, the endowment
of which reaches the enormous
sum of thirty-five million dollars. At
the same time, the State universities,
directly supported by the people, are beginning
to rival privately endowed institutions.
It may be confidently
asserted that no nation has ever so
liberally supported higher education,
and the wisdom of this liberality is now
demonstrated, even from the most mercenary
point of view, by the place the
United States has taken in the world’s
commerce. It will be still further demonstrated
in the course of the next
twenty-five years. It is possible that
existing conditions are not favorable to
literature and to art, but the future of
science in the United States is assured
beyond question.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that Government
control and individual initiative
can not be united, but there is no justification
for this view in the development
of the educational and scientific
institutions of the United States. Institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
established by private initiative
have been assisted by the State,
and State institutions have received
large sums from private individuals.
The New York institutions referred to
above&mdash;the American Museum of Natural
History, the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, the Public Library, the Botanical
Gardens and the Zoölogical Park&mdash;are
in almost equal measure supported
by the city and by citizens of the city.
Johns Hopkins University, the University
of Pennsylvania, Cornell University
and other privately endowed institutions
have received assistance from the
State, without any decrease in private
gifts, while the State universities, California
for example, are receiving large
private endowments in addition to their
support from the State. These conditions
may not last, but at all events
they obtain at the present time, and we
find the country in which the largest
gifts from private individuals are made
for education and science to be the
country in which they are most liberally
supported by the Government.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Never before has any government
made such great appropriations for the
development of the resources of the
country or for the advance of science
as the Congress which has just adjourned.
We may take for example
the Department of Agriculture, for
which the appropriation is $4,023,500,
an increase of more than $280,000 over
the appropriation for the preceding
year. Every one familiar with the conditions
at Washington and throughout
the country will know that this large
sum of money is expended with the utmost
economy, and there is no doubt
but what the money invested by the
nation is returned to the people many
fold in the course of every year. Some
of the items of the bill deserve special
notice. Thus, a new agricultural experiment
station is to be established in
the Hawaiian Islands, and the work of
the Weather Bureau is to be extended
to them. The agricultural resources
and capabilities of Porto Rico are to be
investigated, and bulletins of information
in English and in Spanish are to
be distributed to the inhabitants. The
division of chemistry is to investigate
the use of food preservatives and coloring
matter, determine their relations
to health and establish the principles
which should guide their use. The
division of forestry receives an increase
of $40,000 and the Weather Bureau an
increase of over $35,000. Other items of
the appropriation act are as follows:
Biological Survey, $30,300, an increase
of $2,740; Division of Botany, $43,080,
an increase of $14,280; Nutrition Investigation,
$17,500, an increase of
$2,500; Division of Pomology, $18,400;
Public Road Inquiry, $14,000, an increase
of $6,000; Division of Statistics,
$146,160; Library, $14,000; and Museum,
$2,260.</p>

<p>While American men of wealth
have given freely of their means for the
promotion of education and science,
they have not so often devoted their
own time to its service. This is natural,
as the wealth has in most cases
been acquired by the present generation,
and it is in succeeding generations,
when families have been established,
that leisure and wealth will give a class
similar to that which has accomplished
so much for Great Britain and to a
lesser extent for Germany and France.
Still, it is the case that the heads of
two of our chief universities are men
of great wealth, who have devoted not
only their means, but also their services
to the cause of education, and there are
in our universities and other institutions
many who hold their positions
purely out of interest in their work,
not as a means for their support. In
the next generation there will probably
be more representatives of a class to
which belonged the Duke of Argyll,
whose death we were compelled to record
last month. Another man has since
died of a somewhat similar type. When
Colonel Lane-Fox somewhat unexpectedly
succeeded to large estates in Wiltshire
and Dorsetshire and assumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
name Pitt-Rivers, his chief interest
seemed to be in the earth works and
tumuli of Cranbourne Chase, and the
extensive memoirs he has published
and the museum he has established
show what good use he made of the excavations.
Some of the results of his
earlier work will be found at Oxford,
but he built at Farnham, in Dorsetshire,
a museum which contains collections
of the greatest possible value.</p>

<p>The <a href="#tesla">communication</a> in this issue
signed ‘Physicist’ is worthy of note. If
what its writer says is true, it is evident
that a reputation as a brilliant inventor
does not insure that its possessor
is a safe writer about general physics.
Our correspondent, who represents
fairly the opinion of scientific men in
general, finds fault with Mr. Tesla’s
article in the June <i>Century</i> in many
important particulars. During the
years since Mr. Tesla’s notable invention
of the polyphase alternate current
transformer, he seems to have become
less definite and exact in his thinking,
and less productive as an inventor.
The speculation and rhetoric of the
<i>Century</i> article are certainly disappointing
to every one who is trying to
bring about an intelligent and sound
view of science on the part of non-scientific
people. Men of science everywhere
should certainly make it their
business to instruct people in general
about the progress, and even the prospects,
of science through the press, but
it takes wisdom on the part of both
writers and editors to know what is
instructive and what is misleading.
Honest criticism such as that of our
correspondent is therefore highly desirable.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that the most
important advance of last year in the
science of medicine was the discovery
that the parasite causing malaria was
transmitted from person to person by
mosquitoes. Dr. Manson describes this
discovery fully in <a href="#malaria">this number</a> of the
<span class="smcap">Popular Science Monthly</span>. This
summer a crucial experiment is being
made of a somewhat dramatic character.
A mosquito-proof tent has been
constructed, which is located in Italy,
in the Campagna. In this Dr. Luigi
Sambon, lecturer of the London Tropical
School of Medicine, and Dr. G.&nbsp;C.
Low will live until October, taking the
utmost care not to be bitten by mosquitoes.
If they escape malaria it will
serve as corroborative evidence that the
mosquito is the means of infection.
On the other hand, several Englishmen,
including Dr. Manson’s son, have offered
themselves as subjects for the
complementary experiment. They will
live in a healthy district, but will
definitely allow themselves to be bitten
by mosquitoes which are known to be
infected. These experiments will probably
be particularly useful in demonstrating
to the public at large the
validity of the hypothesis derived last
year from technical bacteriological evidence.</p>
